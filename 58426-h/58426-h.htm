<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The aim of this little volume is to present all that
is most enduring and memorable in the public
orations and private sayings of the prophet
Mohammad in such a form that the general
reader may be tempted to learn a little of what a
great man was and of what made him great. At
present, it must be allowed that although “Auld
Mahound” is a household word, he is very little
more than a word. Things are constantly being
said, written, and preached about the Arab prophet
and the religion he taught, of which an elementary
acquaintance with him would show the absurdity.
No one would dare to treat the ordinary classics
of European literature in this fashion; or, if he
did, his exposure would immediately ensue. What
I wish to do is to enable any one, at the cost of
the least possible exertion, to put himself into a
position to judge of popular fallacies about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a>[Pg vi]</span>
Mohammad and his creed as surely and certainly
as he can judge of errors in ordinary education
and scholarship. I do not wish to mention the
Korān by name more than can be helped, for I have
observed that the word has a deterrent effect upon
readers who like their literary food light and easy
of digestion. It cannot, however, be disguised
that a great deal of this book consists of the
Korān, and it may therefore be as well to explain
away as far as possible the prejudice which the
ill-fated name is apt to excite. It is not easy to
say for how much of this prejudice the standard
English translator is responsible. The patient
and meritorious George Sale put the Korān into
tangled English and heavy quarto,&mdash;people read
quartos then and did not call them <i>éditions de
luxe</i>,&mdash;his version then appeared in a clumsy
octavo, with most undesirable type and paper;
finally it has come out in a cheap edition, of which
it need only be said that utility rather than taste
has been consulted. One can hardly blame any
one for refusing to look even at the outsides of
these volumes. And the inside,&mdash;not the mere outward
inside, if I may so say, the type and paper,&mdash;but
the heart of hearts, the matter itself, is by no
means calculated to tempt a reluctant reader.
The Korān is there arranged according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a>[Pg vii]</span>
orthodox form, instead of in chronological order,&mdash;it
must be allowed that the chronological order
was not discovered in Sale’s time,&mdash;and the result
is that impression of chaotic indefiniteness which
impressed Carlyle so strongly, and which Carlyle
has impressed upon most of the present generation.
A large disorderly collection of prophetic rhapsody
did not prove inviting, as the state of popular
knowledge about Mohammad very clearly shows.</p>

<p>The attitude of the multitude towards Sale’s
Korān was on the whole reasonable. But if the
faults that were found there are shown to belong
to Sale and not to the Korān, or only partly to it,
the attitude should change. In the first place, the
Korān is not a large book, and in the second, it is
by no means so disorderly and anarchic as is
commonly supposed. Reckoned by the number
of verses, the Korān is only two-thirds of the
length of the New Testament, or, if the wearisome
stories of the Jewish patriarchs which Mohammad
told and retold are omitted, it is no more than the
Gospels and Acts. It has been remarked that the
Sunday edition of the <i>New York Herald</i> is three
times as long. But the real permanent contents
of the Korān may be taken at far less even than
this estimate. The book is full&mdash;I will not say of
vain repetitions, for in teaching and preaching re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[Pg viii]</span>petition
is necessary&mdash;but of reiterations of certain
cardinal articles of faith, and certain standard demonstrations
of these articles by the analogy of
nature. Like the numerous stories borrowed by
Mohammad from the Talmud, which have little
but an antiquarian interest, many of these reiterated
arguments and illustrations may with advantage
be passed over. There is also a considerable
portion of the Korān which is devoted to
the exposure and confutation of those who, from
political, commercial, or religious motives, made
it their business to thwart Mohammad in his efforts
to reform his people. These personal, one might
say party, speeches are valuable only to the
biographer and historian of the times. They
throw but little light on the character of the man
Mohammad himself. They show him, indeed, to
be&mdash;what we knew him before&mdash;a sensitive,
irritable man, keenly alive to ridicule and scorn.
But for this purpose one instance is sufficient.
We do not form our estimate of a great statesman
from his moments of irritation, but from those
larger utterances which reveal the results of a
life’s study of men and government. So with
Mohammad, we may abandon the personal and
temporary element in the Korān, and base our
judgment upon those utterances which stand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>[Pg ix]</span>
all time, and deal not with individuals or classes,
but with man as he is, in Arabia or England, or
where we will. This position is not taken with
the object of saving Mohammad from himself.
His attacks upon his opponents will bear comparison
with those of other statesmen. They are
doubtless couched in more barbaric language than
we are accustomed to, and where we insinuate,
Mohammad curses outright. But in the face of a
treacherous and malignant opposition, the Arabian
prophet comported himself with singular self-restraint.
He only threatened hell-fire, and
people of all denominations are still threatened
with that every Sunday, to say nothing of Lent.
Leaving out the Jewish stories, needless repetitions,
and temporary exhortations or personal vindications,
the speeches of Mohammad may be set forth
in very moderate compass. One speech&mdash;<i>sura</i>, or
chapter, as it is generally called&mdash;follows another
so much to the same effect, that a limited number
will be found to contain all the ideas which a
minute study of the whole Korān could collect.
I believe there is nothing important, either in
doctrine or style, which is not contained in the
twenty-eight speeches which fill the first hundred
and thirty pages of this small volume. If I were
a Mohammadan, I think I could accept the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
collection as a sufficient representation of what the
Korān teaches.</p>

<p>The obscurity of the Korān is largely due to its
ordinary arrangement. This consists merely in
putting the longest chapters first and the shortest
last. The Mohammadans appear to be contented
with this curious order, which after all is not
more remarkable than that of some other sacred
books. German criticism, however, has discovered
the method of arranging the Korān in approximately
chronological sequence. To explain how
this is established would carry me too far, but the
results are certain. We can state positively that
the chapters of the Korān&mdash;or, as I prefer to call
them, the speeches of Mohammad&mdash;fall into certain
definite chronological groups, and if we
cannot arrange each individual speech in its
precise place, we can at least tell to which group,
extending over but few years, it belongs. The
effect of this critical arrangement is to throw a
perfectly clear light on the development of Mohammad’s
teaching, and the changes in his style and
method. When the Korān is thus arranged&mdash;as
it is in Mr. Rodwell’s charming version, which
deserves to be better read than it is&mdash;the impression
of anarchy disappears, and we see only the
growth of a remarkable mind, the alternations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
weakness and strength in a gifted soul, the inevitable
inconsistencies of a great man. I do not
believe any one who reads the speeches of
Mohammad as I have arranged them in Professor
Nöldeke’s chronological order will say that they
have no definite aim or coherence. They may
be monotonous, and often they are rambling,
but their intention and sequence of thought are
to me clear as noonday.</p>

<p>It is something more, however, than any
supposed length or obscurity that has hitherto
scared people from the Koran. The truth is that
the atmosphere of our Arabian prophet’s thoughts
is so different from what we breathe ourselves, that it
needs a certain effort to transplant ourselves into it.
That it can be done, and done triumphantly, may
be proved by Mr. Browning’s <i>Saul</i>, as Semitic a
poem as ever came from the desert itself. We
see the whole life and character of the Bedawy in
these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Oh, our manhood’s prime vigour! No spirit feels waste,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Oh, the wild joys of living! the leaping from rock unto rock,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The strong rending of boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver shock</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Of the plunge in the pool’s living water, the hunt of the bear,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold dust divine,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the locust flesh steeped in the pitcher, the deep draught of wine,</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span>
<div class="verse0">And the sleep in the dried river-channel, where bulrushes tell</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">That the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">How good is man’s life, the mere living! how fit to employ</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy.</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p>It is not easy to catch the Arab spirit as Mr.
Browning has caught it. Arab poetry is a sealed
book to most, even among special Orientalists;
they construe it, but it does not move them. The
cause is to be found in the abrupt transition of
thought which is required if we would enter into
the spirit of desert song. The Arab stands in
direct contrast to ourselves of the north. He is
not in the least like an Englishman. His mind
travels by entirely different routes from ours, and
his body is built up of much more inflammable
materials. His free desert air makes him impatient
of control in a degree which we can
scarcely understand in an organised community. It
is difficult now to conceive a nation without cabinets
and secretaries of State and policemen, yet to
the Arab these things were not only unknown but
inconceivable. He lived the free aimless satisfied
life of a child. He was supremely content with
the exquisite sense of simple existence, and was
happy because he lived. Throughout a life that
was full of energy, of passion, of strong endeavour
after his ideal of desert perfectness, there was yet
a restful sense of satisfied enjoyment, a feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a>[Pg xiii]</span>
life was of a surety well worth living. What his
ideal was, and how different from any of the ideals
of to-day, we know from his own poetry. It was,
not in the gentler virtues that he prided himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Had I been a son of Māzin, there had not plundered my herds</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">the sons of the child of the dust, Dhuhl, son of Sheybān.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">There had straightway arisen to help me a heavy-handed kin,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">good smiters when help is needed, though the feeble bend to the blow:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Men who, when Evil bares before them his hindmost teeth,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">fly gaily to meet him in companies or alone.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They ask not their brother, when he lays before them his wrong</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">in his trouble, to give them proof of the truth of what he says.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">But as for my people, though their number be not small,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">they are good for naught against evil, however light it be;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They requite with forgiveness the wrong of those that do them wrong,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">and the evil deeds of the evil they meet with kindness and love!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">As though thy Lord had created among the sons of men</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">themselves alone to fear him, and never one man more.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Would that I had in their stead a folk who, when they ride forth,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">strike swiftly and hard, on horse or on camel borne!</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p>The ideal warrior, however, is not always so
fierce as this, as may be seen in the following
lament for a departed hero, where a gentler touch
mingles in its warlike manliness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">But know ye if Abdallah be gone, and his place a void?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">no weakling, unsure of hand, and no holder-back was he!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Alert, keen, his loins well girt, his leg to the middle bare,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">unblemished and clean of limb, a climber to all things high:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">No wailer before ill-luck, one mindful in all he did,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">to think how his work to-day would live in to-morrow’s tale.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Content to bear hunger’s pain, though meat lay beneath his hand,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">to labour in ragged shirt that those whom he served might rest.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a>[Pg xiv]</span>
<div class="verse0">If Dearth laid her hand on him, and Famine devoured his store,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">he gave but the gladlier what little to him they spared.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He dealt as a youth with Youth, until, when his head grew hoar,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">and age gathered o’er his brow, to Lightness he said&mdash;Begone!</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p>The fierceness of the Arab warrior was
tempered by those virtues in which more civilised
nations are found wanting. If he was swift to
strike, the Arab was also prompt to succour, ready
to give shelter and protection even to his worst
enemy. The hospitality of the Arab is a proverb,
but unlike many proverbs it is strictly true. The
last milch-camel must be killed rather than the
duties of the host neglected. The chief of a clan&mdash;not
necessarily the richest man in it, but the
strongest and wisest&mdash;set the example in all Arab
virtues, and his tent was so placed in the camp
that it was the first the enemy would attack, and
also the first that the wayworn traveller would
approach. Beacons were lighted hard by to guide
wanderers to the hospitable haven, and any man,
of whatever condition, who came to the Arab
nobleman’s tent and said, “I throw myself on your
honour,” was safe from pursuit even at the cost of
his host’s life. Honour, like hospitality, meant
more than it does now; and the Arab chieftain’s
pledge of welcome meant protection, unswerving
fidelity, help, and succour. Like his pride of
birth, devotion to the clan, courage, and generosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a>[Pg xv]</span>
this hospitable trusty friendship of the Arab belongs
no doubt to the barbarous virtues of the old
world; but it is just these parts of barbarism which
civilisation might profitably emulate.</p>

<p>As a friend and as an enemy there was no
ambiguity about the Arab. In both relations he
was frank, generous, and fearless. And the same
may be said of his love. The Arab of the Days
of Ignorance, as Mohammadans style the time
before the birth of their prophet, was the forerunner
of the best side of mediæval chivalry, which
indeed is forced to own an Arabian origin. The
Arab chief was as much a knight-errant in love as
he was a chivalrous opponent in fight. The position
of the women of Arabia before the coming of
Mohammad has often been commiserated. That
women were probably held in low esteem in the
town-life which formed an important factor in the
Arabian polity is probably true; savage virtues are
apt to disappear in the civilised society of cities.
But poetry is a good test of a nation’s character,&mdash;not,
perhaps, of a highly civilised nation, for then
affectation and the <i>vogue</i> come into play,&mdash;but
undoubtedly of a partly savage nation, where
poets only say what they and their fellow men feel.
Arabian poetry is full of a chivalrous reverence for
women. Allowing for difference of language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a>[Pg xvi]</span>
the varieties of human nature, it is much more
reverent than a great deal of the poetry of our own
country to-day. In the old days, says an ancient
writer, the true Arab had but one love, and her
he loved till death. The Bedawy or Arab of
the desert, though he was not above a certain
amount of gallantry of a romantic and exciting
order, regarded women as divinities to be worshipped,
not as chattels to possess. The poems
are full of instances of the courtly respect, “full
of state and ancientry,” displayed by the heroes
of the desert towards defenceless maidens, and
the mere existence of so general an ideal of conduct
in the poems is a strong argument for Arab chivalry;
for with the Arabs the abyss between the
ideal accepted of the mind and the attaining thereof
in action was narrower than it is among more
advanced nations. We remember the story of
Antar, the Bayard of pagan Arabia, who gave his
life to guard some helpless women; and recall
these verses of Muweylik, which breathe a tender
chivalrous regret for an only love:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Take thou thy way by the grave wherein thy dear one lies&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">Umm el-´Alā&mdash;and lift up thy voice: ah! if she could hear!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">How art thou come, for very fearful wast thou, to dwell</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">in a land where not the most valiant goes but with quaking heart?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">God’s love be thine and His mercy, O thou dear lost one!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">not meet for thee is the place of shadow and loneliness.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a>[Pg xvii]</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And a little one hast thou left behind&mdash;God’s ruth on her!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">she knows not what to bewail thee means, yet weeps for thee,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">For she misses those sweet ways of thine which thou hadst with her,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">and the long night wails, and we strive to hush her to sleep in vain.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">When her crying smites in the night upon my sleepless ears,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse1">straightway mine eyes brimful are filled from the well of tears.</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p>If anywhere poetry is a gauge of national
character, it was so in Arabia, for nowhere was it
more a part of the national life. That line, “to
think how his work to-day would live in to-morrow’s
tale,” is a true touch. The Arabs were before all
things a poetical people. It is not easy to judge of
this poetry in translation, even in the fine renderings
which I have taken above from Mr. C. J. Lyall,
but its effect on the Arabs themselves was unmistakeable.
Damiri has a saying, “Wisdom hath
alighted on three things, the brain of the Franks,
the hands of the Chinese, and the tongue of the
Arabs,” and the last is not the least true. They
had an annual fair, the <i>Académie française</i> of
Arabia, where the poets of rival clans recited
their masterpieces before immense audiences, and
received the summary criticism of the multitude.
This fair of Okadh was a literary congress, without
formal judges, but with unbounded influence. It
was here that the polished heroes of the desert
determined points of grammar and prosody; here
the seven “Golden Songs” were sung, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"></a>[Pg xviii]</span>
(alas for the legend!) they were <i>not</i> afterwards
suspended in the Kaaba; and here “a magical
language, the language of the Hijaz,” was built
out of the dialects of Arabia and made ready
to the skilful hand of Mohammad, that he might
conquer the world with his Korān.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have been looking at but one side
of Arab life. The Bedawis were indeed the bulk
of the race and furnished the swords of the Muslim
conquests; but there was also a vigorous town-life
in Arabia, and the citizens waxed rich with the
gains of their trafficking. For through Arabia ran
the trade-route between east and west: it was
the Arab traders who carried the produce of the
Yemen to the markets of Syria; and how ancient
was their commerce one may divine from the
words of a poet of Judaea, spoken more than a
thousand years before the coming of Mohammad&mdash;</p>

<p>Mekka was the centre of this trading life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"></a>[Pg xix]</span>
typical Arab city of old times, a stirring little town,
with its caravans bringing the silks and woven
stuffs of Syria and the far-famed damask, and
carrying away the sweet-smelling produce of
Arabia, frankincense, cinnamon, sandal-wood,
aloe and myrrh, and the dates and leather and
metals of the south, and the goods that came to
the Yemen from Africa and even India; its
assemblies of merchant-princes in the Council Hall
near the Kaaba; and again its young poets running
over with love and gallantry; its Greek and Persian
slave-girls brightening the luxurious banquet with
their native songs, when as yet there was no Arab
school of music and the monotonous but not
unmelodious chant of the camel-driver was the
national song of Arabia; and its club, where busy
men spent their idle hours in playing chess and
draughts, or in gossiping with their acquaintance.
It was a little republic of commerce, too much
infected with the luxuries and refinements of the
states it traded with, yet retaining enough of the
free Arab nature to redeem it from the charge of
effeminacy. Mekka was a home of music and
poetry, and this characteristic lasted into Muslim
times. There is a story of a certain stonemason
who had a wonderful gift of singing. When he
was at work the young men used to come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a>[Pg xx]</span>
importune him, and bring him gifts of money and
food to induce him to sing. He would then make
a stipulation that they should first help him with
his work. And forthwith they would strip off
their cloaks, and the stones would gather round
him rapidly. Then he would mount a rock and
sing, whilst the whole hill was coloured red and
yellow with the variegated garments of his audience.
It was, however, in this town-life that the worst
qualities of the Arab came out; it was here that
his raging passion for dicing and his thirst for
wine were most prominent. In the desert there
was no great opportunity for indulging in either
luxury, but in a town which often welcomed a caravan
bringing goods to the value of twenty thousand
pound such excesses were to be looked for.
Excited by the songs of the Greek slave-girls, and
the fumes of mellow wine, the Mekkan would
throw the dice till, like the German of Tacitus, he
had staked and lost his own liberty.</p>

<p>But Mekka was more than a centre of trade
and of song. It was the focus of the religion of the
Arabs. Thither the tribes went up every year to
kiss the black stone which had fallen from heaven
in the primeval days of Adam, and to make the
seven circuits of the Kaaba, naked,&mdash;for they
would not approach God in the garments in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a>[Pg xxi]</span>
they had done their sins,&mdash;and to perform the other
ceremonies of the pilgrimage. The Kaaba, a
cubical building in the centre of Mekka, was the
most sacred temple in all Arabia, and it gave its
sanctity to all the district around. It was built,
saith tradition, by Adam from a heavenly model,
and then rebuilt from time to time by Seth and
Abraham and Ishmael, and less reverend persons,
and it contained the sacred things of the land.
Here was the black stone, here the great god
of red agate, and the three hundred and sixty
idols, one for each day of the year, which
Mohammad afterwards destroyed in one day.
Here was Abraham’s stone, and that other which
marked the tomb of Ishmael, and hard by was
Zemzem, the God-sent spring which gushed from
the sand when the forefather of the Arabs was
perishing of thirst.</p>

<p>The religion of the ancient Arabs, little as we
know of it, is especially interesting inasmuch as
the Arabs longest retained the original Semitic
character, and hence probably the original
Semitic religion; and thus in the ancient cult of
Arabia we may see the religion once professed by
Chaldeans, Canaanites, Israelites, and Ph&oelig;nicians.
This ancient religion “rises little higher than
animistic polydaemonism; it is a collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a>[Pg xxii]</span>
tribal religions standing side by side, only loosely
united, though there are traces of a once closer
connection.” The great objects of worship were
the sun, and the stars, and the three moon-goddesses,&mdash;El-Lāt,
the bright moon, Menāh, the
dark, and El-´Uzza, the union of the two&mdash;whilst a
lower cultus of trees, stones, and mountains shows
that the religion had not quite risen above simple
fetishism. There are traces of a belief in a
supreme God behind this pantheon, and the moon-goddesses
and other divinities were regarded as
daughters of the Most High God (Allāh ta´āla).
The various deities (but not the supreme Allāh)
had their fanes where human sacrifices, though
rare, were not unknown; and their cult was
superintended by a hereditary line of seers, who
were held in great reverence, but never developed
into a priestly caste.</p>

<p>Besides the tribal gods, individual households
had their special <i>penates</i>, to whom was due the
first and the last salām of the returning or outgoing
master. But in spite of all this superstitious
apparatus the Arabs were never a religious people.
In the old days, as now, they were reckless,
sceptical, materialistic. They had their gods and
their divining arrows, but they were ready to
demolish both if the responses proved contrary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"></a>[Pg xxiii]</span>
their wishes. An Arab, who wished to avenge
the death of his father, went to consult the square
block of white stone called El-Khalasa, by means
of divining arrows. Three times he tried, and
each time he drew the arrow forbidding vengeance.
Then he broke the arrows, and flung them in the
face of the idol, crying, “Wretch! if it had been
<i>your</i> father who was murdered, you would not
have forbidden me to avenge him!” The great
majority believed in no future life, nor in a reckoning
day of good and evil. If a few tied camels to
the graves of the dead that the corpse might ride
mounted to the judgment-seat, they must have
done so more by force of superstitious habit than
anything else.</p>

<p>Christianity and Judaism had made but small
impress upon the Arabs. There were Jewish
tribes in the north, and there is evidence in the
Korān and elsewhere that the traditions and rites
of Judaism were widely known in Arabia. But the
creed was too narrow and too exclusively national
to commend itself to the majority of the people.
Christianity fared even worse. Whether or not
St. Paul went there, it is at least certain that very
little effect was produced by the preaching of
Christianity in Arabia. We hear of Christians on
the borders, and even two or three among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"></a>[Pg xxiv]</span>
Mekkans, and bishops and churches are spoken of
at Dhafār and Nejrān. But the Christianity that
the Arabs knew was, like the Judaism of the
northern tribes, a very imperfect reflection of the
faith it professed to be. It had become a thing
of the head instead of the heart, and the refinements
of monophysite and monothelite doctrines
gained no hold on the Arab mind.</p>

<p>Thus Judaism and Christianity, though they
were well known, and furnished many of the ideas
and most of the ceremonies of Islām, were never
able to effect any general settlement in Arabia.
The common Arabs did not care much about any
religion, and the finer spirits found the wrangling
dogmatism of the Christian and the narrow isolation
of the Jew little to their mind. For there
were men before the time of Mohammad who were
dissatisfied with the low fetishism in which their
countrymen were plunged, and who protested
emphatically against the idle and often cruel
superstitions of the Arabs. Not to refer to the
prophets, who, as the Korān relates, were sent in
old times to the tribes of Ad and Thamūd to
convert them, there was, immediately before the
preaching of Mohammad, a general feeling that a
change was at hand; a prophet was expected, and
women were anxiously hoping for male children, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv"></a>[Pg xxv]</span>
so be they might mother the Apostle of God; and
the more thoughtful minds, tinged with traditions
of Judaism, were seeking for what they called the
“religion of Abraham.” These men were called
“Hanīfs,” or “incliners,” and their religion seems
to have consisted chiefly in a negative position,&mdash;in
denying the superstition of the Arabs, and in only
asserting the existence of one sole-ruling God
whose absolute slaves are all mankind&mdash;without
being able to decide on any minor doctrines, or to
determine in what manner this One God was to be
worshipped. So long as the Hanīfs could give
their countrymen no more definite creed than this,
their influence was limited to a few inquiring and
doubting minds. It was reserved for Mohammad
to formulate the faith of the Hanīfs in the dogmas
of Islām.</p>

<p>It is essential to bear in mind all these surroundings
of Mohammad if we would understand
his position and influence. A desert Arab in love
of liberty and worship of nature’s beauty, but lacking
something of the frank chivalrous spirit of the
desert warrior&mdash;more a saint than a knight,&mdash;yet
possessing a patient determined perseverance
which belonged to the life of the town, a moral
force which the roaming Bedawy did not need,
Mohammad owed something to either side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"></a>[Pg xxvi]</span>
Arabian life; whilst without the influence of other
religions, especially the Jewish, he could never
have come forward as the preacher of Islām.
Even the old nature worship of the Arabs had its
share in the new religion, and no faith was made
up of more varied materials than that which
Mohammad impressed upon so large a portion of
mankind.</p>

<p>Of his early life very little is known. He was
born in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 571, and came of the noble tribe of
the Koreysh, who had long been guardians of the
sacred Kaaba. He lost both his parents early,
and as his branch of the tribe had become poor,
his duty was to betake himself to the hillsides and
pasture the flocks of his neighbours. In after
years he would look back with pleasure on these
days, and say that God took never a prophet save
from among the sheep-folds. The life on the hills
gave him the true shepherd’s eye for nature which
is seen in every speech of the Korān; and it was
in those solitary watches under the silent sky, with
none near to distract him, that he began those
earnest communings with his soul which made him
in the end the prophet of his nation. Beyond this
shepherd life and his later and more adventurous
trade of camel-driver to the Syrian caravans of his
rich cousin, Khadīja, whom he presently married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii"></a>[Pg xxvii]</span>
at the age of twenty-five, there is little that can be
positively asserted of Mohammad’s youth. He
must have witnessed the poets’ contests at the
Fair of ´Okadh, and listened to the earnest talk
of the Jews and Hanīfs who visited the markets;
he may have heard a little, dimly, of Jesus of
Nazareth; what he did we know not; what he
was is expressed in the nickname by which he was
known&mdash;“El-Amīn,” the Trusty.</p>

<p>“Mohammad was of the middle height, rather
thin, but broad of shoulders, wide of chest, strong
of bone and muscle. His head was massive,
strongly developed. Dark hair, slightly curled,
flowed in a dense mass almost to his shoulders;
even in advanced age it was sprinkled with only
about twenty gray hairs, produced by the agonies
of his ‘Revelations.’ His face was oval-shaped,
slightly tawny of colour. Fine long arched eyebrows
were divided by a vein, which throbbed
visibly in moments of passion. Great black
restless eyes shone out from under long heavy
eyelashes. His nose was large, slightly aquiline.
His teeth, upon which he bestowed great care,
were well set, dazzling white. A full beard framed
his manly face. His skin was clear and soft, his
complexion ‘red and white,’ his hands were as
‘silk and satin,’ even as those of a woman. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii"></a>[Pg xxviii]</span>
step was quick and elastic, yet firm as that of one
who steps ‘from a high to a low place.’ In turning
his face he would also turn his whole body.
His whole gait and presence were dignified and
imposing. His countenance was mild and pensive.
His laugh was rarely more than a smile.</p>

<p>“In his habits he was extremely simple, though
he bestowed great care on his person. His eating
and drinking, his dress and his furniture retained,
even when he had reached the fulness of power,
their almost primitive nature. The only luxuries
he indulged in were, besides arms, which he highly
prized, a pair of yellow boots, a present from the
Negus of Abyssinia. Perfumes, however, he
loved passionately, being most sensitive to smells.
Strong drink he abhorred.</p>

<p>“His constitution was extremely delicate. He
was nervously afraid of bodily pain; he would sob
and roar under it. Eminently unpractical in all
common things of life, he was gifted with mighty
powers of imagination, elevation of mind, delicacy
and refinement of feeling. ‘He is more modest
than a virgin behind her curtain,’ it was said of
him. He was most indulgent to his inferiors, and
would never allow his awkward little page to be
scolded whatever he did. ‘Ten years,’ said Anas
his servant, ‘was I about the Prophet, and he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix"></a>[Pg xxix]</span>
said as much as “uff” to me.’ He was very affectionate
towards his family. One of his boys died on
his breast in the smoky house of the nurse, a blacksmith’s
wife. He was very fond of children; he
would stop them in the streets and pat their little
heads. He never struck any one in his life. The
worst expression he ever made use of in conversation
was, ‘What has come to him? may his forehead
be darkened with mud!’ When asked to curse
some one, he replied, ‘I have not been sent to
curse, but to be a mercy to mankind.’ ‘He visited
the sick, followed any bier he met, accepted the
invitation of a slave to dinner, mended his own
clothes, milked the goats, and waited upon himself,’
relates summarily another tradition. He
never first withdrew his hand out of another man’s
palm, and turned not before the other had turned.</p>

<p>“He was the most faithful protector of those
he protected, the sweetest and most agreeable in
conversation. Those who saw him were suddenly
filled with reverence; those who came near him
loved him; they who described him would say, ‘I
have never seen his like either before or after.’
He was of great taciturnity, but when he spoke it
was with emphasis and deliberation, and no one
could forget what he said. He was, however, very
nervous and restless withal; often low-spirited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx"></a>[Pg xxx]</span>
downcast, as to heart and eyes. Yet he would at
times suddenly break through these broodings,
become gay, talkative, jocular, chiefly among his
own. He would then delight in telling little
stories, fairy tales, and the like. He would romp
with the children and play with their toys.”</p>

<p>“He lived with his wives in a row of humble
cottages, separated from one another by palm-branches,
cemented together with mud. He would
kindle the fire, sweep the floor, and milk the goats
himself. The little food he had was always shared
with those who dropped in to partake of it. Indeed,
outside the prophet’s house was a bench or
gallery, on which were always to be found a number
of poor, who lived entirely upon his generosity,
and were hence called ‘the people of the bench.’
His ordinary food was dates and water, or barley
bread; milk and honey were luxuries of which he
was fond, but which he rarely allowed himself.
The fare of the desert seemed most congenial to
him, even when he was sovereign of Arabia.”</p>

<p>Mohammad was forty before he began his
mission of reform. He may long have doubted
and questioned with himself, but at least outwardly
he seems to have conformed to the popular religion.
At length, as he was keeping the sacred months,
the God’s Truce of the Arabs, in prayer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi"></a>[Pg xxxi]</span>
fasting on Mount Hirā, “a huge barren rock, torn
by cleft and hollow ravine, standing out solitary
in the full white glare of the desert sun,” he thought
he heard a voice say “Cry.” “What shall I cry?”
he answered. And the voice said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">“Cry! in the name of thy Lord, who created&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Created man from blood.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Cry! for thy Lord is the Bountifullest!</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Taught man what he did not know.”</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p class="right">
<i>Korān</i>, ch. xcvi.
</p>

<p>At first he thought he was possessed with a devil,
and the refuge of suicide was often present to his
mind. But yet again he heard the voice&mdash;“Thou
art the Messenger of God, and I am Gabriel.”
He went back to Khadīja, worn out in body and
mind. “Wrap me, wrap me,” he cried. And
then the word came to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">“O thou who art wrapped, rise up and warn!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And thy Lord magnify,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And thy raiment purify,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And abomination shun!</div><!--verse-->

</div></div>

<p class="right">
<i>Korān</i>, ch. lxxiv.
</p>

<p>These are the first two revelations that came to
Mohammad. That he believed he heard them
spoken by an angel from heaven is beyond doubt.
His temperament was nervous and excitable from
a child up. It is said he was subject to cataleptic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii"></a>[Pg xxxii]</span>
fits, like Swedenborg; and at least it is certain that
his constitution was more delicately and highly
strung than most men’s. If it is any satisfaction
to the incredulous to find evidence of a special
tendency towards hallucinations, the proofs are at
hand. But whether the “revelations” were subjective
or not makes no difference to the result.
Whencesoever they came, they were real and
potent revelations to the man and to his people.</p>

<p>After this beginning of converse with the
supernatural, or whatever we prefer to term it, the
course of Mohammad’s revelations&mdash;the speeches
which make up the Korān&mdash;flowed unbroken for
twenty years and more. They fall naturally into
two great divisions&mdash;the period of struggle at
Mekka, and the period of triumph at Medina;
and the characteristics of the two are diverse
as the circumstances which called them forth.
For whatever Mohammad himself thought of his
revelations, to modern criticism they are speeches
or sermons strictly connected with the religious
and political circumstances of the speaker’s time.
In the first period we see a man possessed
of a strong religious idea, an idea dominating
his life, and his one aim is to impress that
idea on his people, the inhabitants of Mekka.
He preached to them in season and out of season;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[Pg xxxiii]</span>
whenever the spirit moved him he poured forth his
burning eloquence into the ears of a suspicious and
incredulous audience. Three years of unwearied
effort produced the pitiful result of a score or so of
converts, mainly from the poorest classes. In the
fifth year even these were compelled by the persecutions
of the Koreysh to take refuge in Abyssinia&mdash;“a
land of righteousness, wherein no man is
wronged.” Mohammad had by this time advanced
from a mere inculcation of the doctrine of one all-powerful
God to a plain attack upon the idolatry
of the Mekkans; and the Koreysh, as guardians of
the Kaaba and receivers of the pilgrims’ tolls,
were keenly alive to the consequences which the
overthrow of the sacred temple would entail upon
its keepers. The result of Mohammad’s bold
denunciations was a cruel persecution of his
humbler followers, and their consequent flight to
Abyssinia; he himself was too nearly allied to
powerful chiefs to be lightly injured in a land
where the blood-revenge held sway. Presently
the devotion of the prophet, his manly bearing
under obloquy and reproach, and above all, the
winged words of his eloquence, brought several men
of influence and wealth into his faith, and in the
sixth year of his mission Mohammad found himself
surrounded no longer by a crowd of slaves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[Pg xxxiv]</span>
beggars, but by tried swordsmen, chiefs of great
families, leaders in the councils of Mekka; and
the new sect performed their rites no more in
secret, but publicly at the Kaaba, in the face of
the whole city. The Koreysh resolved on stronger
measures. After trying vainly to isolate him from
his family&mdash;the true Arab spirit of kindred was
not so easily shaken&mdash;they put the whole clan
under a ban, and swore they would not marry with
them, nor buy nor sell with them, nor hold with
them any intercourse soever. To the credit of
Mohammad and of his clan, only one man of them
refused to share his fate, though most of them did
not hold with his doctrines. Sooner than give up
their kinsman, they went, every man of them, save
that one, into their own quarter of the city, and
there abode in banishment for two years. Starvation
was busy with the incarcerated family, when
the Koreysh grew ashamed of their work, and five
chiefs arose and put on their armour and went to
the ravine where the banished people were shut
up, and bade them come forth.</p>

<p>The time of inaction was followed by a time of
sorrow. Mohammad lost his wife and the aged
chief, his uncle, who had hitherto been his protector.
All Mekka was against him, and in despair
of heart he journeyed to Taif, seventy miles away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv"></a>[Pg xxxv]</span>
and told his message to another folk: but they
stoned him for three miles from the town. The
time, however, was coming when a distant city
would hold out welcoming hands to the prophet
whom Mekka and Taif had rejected. As he
dwelt-on disconsolately at Mekka, pilgrims from
Yethrib (soon to be known as Medina or Medīnet-en-Neby,
“the Prophet’s City”) hearkened to the
new doctrine, and carried it home to their own
folk. Jews had prepared the way for Islām at
Medina; the new religion did not seem preposterous
to those who had long heard of One God;
and presently the Faithful began to leave Mekka
in small companies, and take refuge in the hospitable
city where their prophet was honoured. At
length Mohammad, when like the captain of a
sinking ship he had seen his followers safely away,
accompanied by one faithful friend eluded the
vigilance of the Koreysh, and safely arrived at
Medina in the early summer of 622. This is the
Hijra or “Flight” of Mohammad, from which the
Muslims date their history.</p>

<p>During these years of struggle and persecution
at Mekka 90 out of the 114 chapters or speeches
which compose the Korān were revealed, amounting
to about two-thirds of the whole book. All
these speeches are inspired with but one great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[Pg xxxvi]</span>
design, and are in strong contrast with the complicated
character of the later chapters issued at
Medina. In the Mekka chapters Mohammad
appears in the unalloyed character of a prophet:
he has not yet assumed the functions of a statesman
and lawgiver. His object is not to give men a
code or a constitution, but to call them to the
worship of the One God. There is hardly a word
of other doctrines, scarcely anything of ritual, or
social or penal regulations. Every speech is
directed simply to the grand design of the Prophet’s
life, to convince men of the unutterable majesty of
the One God, who brooks no rivals. Mohammad
appeals to the people to credit the evidence of their
own eyes; he calls to witness the wonders of nature,
the stars in their courses, the sun and the moon,
the dawn cleaving asunder the dark veil of night,
the life-giving rain, the fruits of the earth, life and
death, change and decay&mdash;all are “signs of God’s
power, if only ye would understand.” Or he tells
the people how it fared with older generations,
when prophets came to them and exhorted them
to believe in One God and do righteousness,
and they rejected them; how there fell upon the
unbelieving nation grievous woe. How was it
with the people of Noah? he asks:&mdash;they were
drowned in the flood because they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[Pg xxxvii]</span>
hearken to his words. And the people of the
Cities of the Plain? And Pharaoh and his host?
And the old tribes of the Arabs who would not
hear the warnings of their prophets? One answer
follows each&mdash;there came upon them a great
calamity. “These are the true stories,” he cries,
“and there is only One God! and yet ye turn
aside.” Eloquent appeals to the signs of nature,
threats of a day of reckoning to come, warnings
drawn from the legends of the prophets, arguments
for the truth and reality of the revelation, make up
the substance of this first division of the Korān.</p>

<p>In the earliest group of speeches delivered at
Mekka, forty-eight in number, belonging to what
is called the First Period, extending over the first
four years of Mohammad’s mission, we feel the
poetry of the man. Mohammad had not lived
among the sheep-folds in vain, and spent long
solitary nights gazing at the silent heaven and
watching the dawn break over the mountains.
This earliest portion of the Korān is one long
blazonry of nature’s beauty. How can you believe
in aught but the One omnipotent God when you
see this glorious world around you and this
wondrous tent of heaven above you? is Mohammad’s
frequent question to his countrymen. “All things
in heaven and earth supplicate Him; then which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[Pg xxxviii]</span>
of the bounties of your Lord will ye deny?” There
is little but this appeal to nature in the first part
of the speeches at Mekka. The prophet was in
too exalted a state during these early years to
stoop to argument; he rather seeks to dazzle the
sense with brilliant images of God’s workings in
creation. “Verily in the creation of the heavens
and the earth are signs to you, if ye would understand.”
His sentences have a rhythmical ring
though they are not in true metre. The lines are
very short, yet with a musical cadence. The
meaning is often but half expressed. The poet
seems impatiently to stop as if he despaired of
explaining himself: he has essayed a thing beyond
words, has discovered the impotence of
language, and broken off with the sentence unfinished.
The style is throughout fiery and impassioned.
The words are those of a man whose
whole heart is bent on convincing, and they carry
with them even now the impression of the burning
vehemence with which they were originally hurled
forth. These earliest speeches are generally brief.
They are pitched too high to be long sustained.
We feel we have here to do with a poet as well
as a preacher, and that his poetry costs him too
much to be spun out.</p>

<p>In urging to repentance and faith, Mohammad’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix"></a>[Pg xxxix]</span>
great weapon is the judgment to come&mdash;the day of
retribution, when all mankind shall be arraigned
before the throne of God; and those who have
done good shall be given the book of the record
of their actions in their right hand, and enjoy
abiding happiness in gardens, under which the rivers
flow; whilst the wicked shall receive his damning
record in his left hand, and be dragged by heel
and hair to hell, to broil therein for ever. The day
of judgment is a stern reality to Mohammad. It
is never out of his thoughts, and he says himself
that if men realised what that day was, they would
weep much and laugh little. He is never tired of
depicting its terrors, and cannot find names
enough to describe it. He calls it the Hour, the
Mighty Day, the great Calamity, the Inevitable
Fact, the Smiting, the Overwhelming, the Hard
Day, the Promised Day, the Day of Decision.</p>

<p>The high poetic fervour of the first group of
Mekka speeches is to some extent lost in the Second,
and still more in the Third period, corresponding
to the fifth and sixth years, and from thence to
the Hijra, respectively, and each comprising twenty-one
speeches. The change is partly one of style,
partly of matter. The verses and the speeches
themselves become longer and more rambling; the
resonant oaths by all the wonders of nature are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl"></a>[Pg xl]</span>
exchanged for the mild asseveration, “By the
Korān.” There is more self-assertion and formality,
and the special words of God are as it
were italicised by the prefixed verb, “Say.” It
must be remembered that the speeches of the
Korān are all supposed to be the utterances of
God <i>in propriâ personâ</i>, of whom Mohammad is
only the mouthpiece. The apparent vindications
and laudations of the prophet himself are explicable
from this point of view; and the reader must
never forget it when he is perplexed by the “we”
(God), and “thou” (Mohammad), and “ye” (the
audience), of the Korān. The most important
alteration to be observed in the progress of the
orations at Mekka is the introduction of numerous
stories derived, with considerable corruptions,
from the Jewish Haggadah. More than fifteen
hundred verses, nearly a quarter of the Kur-ān, are
occupied with wearisome repetitions of these
legends. They are to be seen methodically
arranged in Lane’s <i>Selections from the Kur-ān</i>, and
I need only say that, with the exception of one or
two typical examples (like the speech called <i>The
Moon</i>, p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>), and a few digressions in speeches
(like <i>The Children of Israel</i>, p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>) that were too
important to be omitted, these tales are excluded
from the present collection. Their only real in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli"></a>[Pg xli]</span>terest
is Mohammad’s use of them as evidence of
the continuity of revelation. He believed that all
preceding prophets were inspired of God, and that
they taught the same faith as himself. From
Adam to Jesus they all brought their messages to
their people, and were rejected. He makes them
exhort their people in precisely similar words to
those with which he exhorts the Koreysh. There
is nothing new in his own doctrine, he says, it is
but the teaching of Abraham, of Moses, of Christ,
of all the prophets. But it is the last and best,
the seal of prophecy, after which no other will be
given before the Great Day. It supersedes or
confirms all that goes before.</p>

<p>Quite half of the second group of Mekka
speeches consists of these Jewish legends. There
are not so many in the third, and none in the first.
But if the Third does not contain quite so many of
these tedious fables, it is even tamer in style.
Mohammad seems to be cataloguing the signs of
nature mechanically, and he is constantly recurring
to the charge of forgery which was often brought
against him, or to the demand for miracles, which
he always frankly admitted he could not gratify.
I am only a warner, he said; I cannot show
you a sign&mdash;a miracle&mdash;except what ye see every
day and night. Signs are with God: He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii"></a>[Pg xlii]</span>
could make the heavens could easily show you a
sign if He pleased; beware, lest one day ye see a
sign indeed, and taste in hell that which ye called a
lie! That the old eloquence, in spite of repetition
and wearing trouble, was not dead, may be seen
from the speech called <i>Thunder</i> (p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>), where the
nature painting is as fine as anywhere in the Korān.</p>

<p>The first great division of Mohammad’s speeches,
then, is oratorical rather than dogmatic. He has
a great dogma, indeed, and uses every resource
to recommend it. But there is little detail in these
ninety Mekka speeches. Hardly any definite laws
or precepts are to be found in them, and most of
these in the speech entitled <i>The Children of Israel</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>). Certain general rules of prayer are given,
hospitality and thrift are commended in a breath,
“Let not thy hand be chained to thy neck, nor
yet stretch it out right open;” infanticide, inchastity,
homicide (save in blood-revenge), the
robbing of orphans, a false balance, usury, a broken
covenant, and a proud stomach, are denounced;
certain foods are prohibited; and the whole duty
of man is thus briefly summed up:&mdash;“Say: I am
only a man like you: I am inspired that your God
is but One God. Then let him who hopeth to
meet his Lord do righteousness, and join no (idol)
in his worship of God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii"></a>[Pg xliii]</span></p>

<p>There is little here of a complicated ritual or a
metaphysical theology. Thus far the social and
religious laws which we associate with Islām
are not found in the Mohammadan Bible. We
hear only the voice crying in the wilderness,
“Hear ye, people! The Lord your God is one
Lord.”</p>

<p>Mohammad’s position at Medina was totally
different from that he occupied at Mekka. Instead
of a struggling reformer, despised and ridiculed by
almost every man he met, he was a king, ruling a
large city with despotic power, and needing every
resource of statecraft to maintain order among its
contentious elements. There was a large party,
known in the Korān as the “Disaffected” or
“Hypocrites,” who found it politic to profess
Islām, but were ready to avail themselves of any
propitious occasion to overturn or injure it. Still
more important were the Jewish Arab tribes settled
at Medina, who at first hoped to find a tool to
their hands in the new prophet, who seemed to
teach something very like Judaism; but who, when
they found him unmanageable, straightway turned
upon him with double malignity, and exerted themselves
in all treacherous ways to countermine his
authority and help his enemies within and without
the city. Mohammad has been blamed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv"></a>[Pg xliv]</span>
severity with which he suppressed the rebellious
parties in his state, and the sentences of exile and
death passed upon the Jews have been regarded as
proofs of a vindictive nature. An impartial study
of the facts of the case, however, shows plainly that
strong measures were needed for the preservation
of the Muslim religion and polity; and the vigorous
blows struck by Mohammad at rebellion in
the beginning probably saved bloodshed afterwards.
Whilst the prophet’s supremacy was being established
and maintained among the mixed population
of Medina, a vigorous warfare was carried
on outside with his old persecutors, the Koreysh.
On the history of this war, consisting as it did
mainly of small raids and attacks upon caravans,
I need not dwell. Its leading features were the
two battles of Bedr and Ohud, in the first of which
three hundred Muslims, though outnumbered at
the odds of three to one, were completely victorious
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 624, <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 2); whilst at Ohud, being outnumbered
in the like proportion, and deserted by the
“Disaffected” party, they were almost as decisively
defeated (<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 3). Two years later the Koreysh
gathered together their allies, advanced upon
Medina, and besieged it for fifteen days; but the
foresight of Mohammad in digging a trench, and
the enthusiasm of the Muslims in defending it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv"></a>[Pg xlv]</span>
resisted all assaults, and the coming of the heavy
storms for which the climate of Medina is noted
drove the enemy back to Mekka. The next year
(<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 6) a ten years’ truce (see <i>The Victory</i>, p. <a href="#Page_124">124</a>,
and notes) was concluded with the Koreysh, in
pursuance of which a strange scene took place in the
following spring. It was agreed that Mohammad
and his people should perform the Lesser Pilgrimage,
and that the Koreysh should for that purpose
vacate Mekka for three days. Accordingly in
March 629, about two thousand Muslims, with
Mohammad at their head on his famous camel,
El-Kaswa,&mdash;the camel on which he had fled from
Mekka,&mdash;trooped down the valley and performed
the rites which every Muslim to this day observes.</p>

<p>“It was surely a strange sight which at this time
presented itself in the vale of Mekka, a sight unique
in the history of the world. The ancient city is
for three days evacuated by all its inhabitants,
high and low, every house deserted; and as they
retire, the exiled converts, many years banished
from their birthplace, approach in a great body,
accompanied by their allies, revisit the empty
homes of their childhood, and within the short
allotted space fulfil the rites of pilgrimage. The
ousted inhabitants, climbing the heights around,
take refuge under tents or other shelter among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi"></a>[Pg xlvi]</span>
hills and glens; and clustering on the overhanging
peak of Abu-Kubeys, thence watch the movements
of the visitors beneath them, as with the
Prophet at their head they make the circuit of the
Kaaba and the rapid procession between Es-Safā
and Marwah; and anxiously scan every figure if
perchance they may recognise among the worshippers
some long lost friend or relative. It was
a scene rendered possible only by the throes which
gave birth to Islām.” When the three days were
over, Mohammad and his party peaceably returned
to Medina, and the Mekkans re-entered their
homes. But this pilgrimage, and the self-restraint
of the Muslims therein, advanced the cause of Islām
among its enemies. Converts increased daily, and
some leading men of the Koreysh went over to
Mohammad. The clans around were sending-in
deputations of homage. But the final keystone was
set in the 8th year of the flight (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 630), when
a body of Koreysh broke the truce by attacking
an ally of the Muslims, and Mohammad forthwith
marched upon Mekka with ten thousand men,
and the city, despairing of defence, surrendered.
The day of Mohammad’s greatest triumph over
his enemies was also the day of his grandest victory
over himself. He freely forgave the Koreysh all the
years of sorrow and cruel scorn in which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii"></a>[Pg xlvii]</span>
afflicted him, and gave an amnesty to the whole
population of Mekka. Four criminals whom justice
condemned made up Mohammad’s proscription
list when he entered as a conqueror to the city of
his bitterest enemies. The army followed his
example, and entered quietly and peaceably; no
house was robbed, no women insulted. One thing
alone suffered destruction. Going to the Kaaba,
Mohammad stood before each of the three hundred
and sixty idols, and pointed to it with his staff,
saying, “Truth is come, and falsehood is fled
away!” and at these words his attendants hewed
them down, and all the idols and household gods
of Mekka and round about were destroyed.</p>

<p>It was thus that Mohammad entered again
his native city. Through all the annals of conquest
there is no triumphant entry comparable to
this one.</p>

<p>The taking of Mekka was soon followed by the
adhesion of all Arabia. Every reader knows the
story of the spread of Islām. The tribes of every
part of the peninsula sent embassies to do homage
to the prophet. Arabia was not enough: Mohammad
had written in his bold uncompromising
way to the great kings of the East&mdash;to the Persian
Chosroes and the Greek Emperor; and these little
knew how soon his invitation to the faith would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii"></a>[Pg xlviii]</span>
repeated, and how quickly Islām would be knocking
at their doors with no faltering hand.</p>

<p>The prophet’s career was near its end. In the
tenth year of the flight, twenty-three years after he
had first felt the spirit move him to preach to his
people, he resolved once more to leave his adopted
city and go to Mekka to perform a farewell pilgrimage.
And when the rites were done in the valley
of Minā, the prophet spake unto the multitude&mdash;the
forty thousand pilgrims&mdash;with solemn last
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ye people, hearken to my words: for I know not whether after this
year I shall ever be amongst you here again.</p>

<p>Your lives and your property are sacred and inviolable amongst
one another until the end of time.</p>

<p>The Lord hath ordained to every man the share of his inheritance;
a testament is not lawful to the prejudice of heirs.</p>

<p>The child belongeth to the parent, and the violater of wedlock
shall be stoned.</p>

<p>Ye people, ye have rights demandable of your wives, and they
have rights demandable of you. Treat your women well.</p>

<p>And your slaves, see that ye feed them with such food as ye eat
yourselves, and clothe them with the stuff ye wear. And if they
commit a fault which ye are not willing to forgive, then sell them, for
they are the servants of the Lord and are not to be tormented.</p>

<p>Ye people! hearken unto my speech and comprehend it. Know
that every Muslim is the brother of every other Muslim. All of you
are on the same equality: ye are one brotherhood.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then looking up to heaven he cried, “O Lord, I
have delivered my message and fulfilled my
mission.” And all the multitude answered, “Yea,
verily hast thou!”&mdash;“O Lord, I beseech thee, bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix"></a>[Pg xlix]</span>
Thou witness to it!” and, like Moses, he lifted up
his hands and blessed the people. Three months
more and Mohammad was dead,&mdash;<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 11, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
632.</p>

<p>And when it was noised abroad that the prophet
was dead, Omar, the fiery-hearted, the Simon Peter
of Islām, rushed among the people and fiercely
told them they lied; it could not be true. And
Abu-Bekr came and said, “Ye people! he that
hath worshipped Mohammad, let him know that
Mohammad is dead; but he that hath worshipped
God, that the Lord liveth and doth not die.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The altered circumstances of Mohammad’s life
at Medina produced a corresponding change in his
speeches. They are now not so much exhortations
to unbelievers as directions and encouragements
to the faithful; and instead of being one complete
oration, as most of the early speeches are, they are
a collection of isolated “rulings” on various points
of conduct. The prophet’s house at Medina became
a court of appeal for the whole body of
Muslims. They came to him with all their difficulties,&mdash;domestic,
social, political, religious,&mdash;and
asked for direction. Then Mohammad said in
few words what he thought right and just; and
these decisions have been treated as laws binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l"></a>[Pg l]</span>
upon the Mohammadan world for all time. It is
fortunate that Mohammad was a man of sound
common sense, or the law of Islām would be a
preposterous medley. As it is, it seems clear that
the prophet never wished to lay down a code of
law, and, instead of volunteering rules of conduct
and ritual, used to wait to have them extorted from
him by questioning. “God wishes to make things
easy for you,” he says, “for man was created
weak.” He seems to have distrusted himself as a
lawgiver, for there is a tradition which relates a
speech of his in which he cautions the people
against taking his decision on worldly affairs as
infallible. When he speaks of the things of God
he is to be obeyed; but when he deals with human
affairs he is only a man like those about him. He
was contented to leave the ordinary Arab customs
in force except when they were manifestly unjust.
The truth is that, as in the Mekka speeches so in
those of Medina, the legal and dogmatic element
is curiously small. The greater part of those long
chapters uttered in fragments at Medina, and then
pieced together haphazard by the prophet’s amanuenses,
consists of diatribes against the Jews and
hypocrites, reflections on the conduct of the allies
in battle, encouragement after defeat, exhortations
as to the future, besides a great deal of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li"></a>[Pg li]</span>
matter&mdash;regulations of the prophet’s harem, vindications
of his own or his wives’ conduct,&mdash;and
similar things of a temporary and local interest.
Though the style is monotonous and longwinded,
like the third Mekka period, there are still flashes
of the old eloquence, though perhaps it is less
spontaneous than of old, such as we hear in the
chapter of <i>Light</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">God is the light of the heavens and the earth; his light is as a
niche in which is a lamp, and the lamp in a glass; the glass is as
it were a glittering star: it is lit from a blessed tree, an olive neither
of the east nor of the west, the oil thereof would well-nigh shine
though no fire touched it&mdash;light upon light&mdash;God guideth to His light
whom He pleaseth.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">In the houses God hath suffered to be raised, for His name to be
commemorated therein, men magnify Him at morn and eve:</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Men whom neither merchandise nor trafficking divert from remembering
God and being instant in prayer and giving alms, fearing a
day when hearts and eyes shall quiver;</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">That God may recompense them for the best that they have
wrought, and give them increase of His grace; for God maketh
provision for whom He pleaseth without count.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">But those who disbelieve are like a vapour in a plain: the thirsty
thinketh it water, till, when he cometh to it, he findeth nothing;
but he findeth God with him; and He will settle his account, for
God is quick at reckoning:&mdash;</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Or like black night on a deep sea, which wave above wave doth
cover, and cloud over wave, gloom upon gloom,&mdash;when one putteth
out his hand he can scarcely see it; for to whom God giveth not
light, he hath no light.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Hast thou not seen that what is in the heavens and the earth
magnifieth God, and the birds on the wing? each one knoweth its
prayer and its praise, and God knoweth what they do:</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii"></a>[Pg lii]</span>

<div class="verse0">God’s is the empire of the heavens and the earth, and to Him
must all things return!</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Hast thou not seen that God driveth the clouds, and then joineth

on whom He pleaseth, and He turneth it away from whom He
pleaseth: the flashing of His lightning well nigh consumeth the
eyes!</div><!--verse-->
</div></div>

<p class="right">xxiv. 35-43.</p>

<p>The actual legal residue in the Medina chapters
is singularly small. Chapters ii., iv., and v., contain
nearly all the law of the Korān; but it must
be allowed they are very long chapters, and form
nearly a tenth part of it. Their practical import,&mdash;the
definite ruling of Mohammad on dogmatic,
ritual, civil, and criminal matters,&mdash;is collected
in pp. <a href="#Page_133">133</a>-<a href="#Page_144">144</a>, and need not be repeated here.
The conclusion, however, is worth pointing clearly.
The Korān does not contain, even in outline, the
elaborate ritual and complicated law which now
passes under the name of Islām. It contains
merely those decisions which happened to be
called for at Medina. Mohammad himself knew
that it did not provide for every emergency, and
recommended a principle of analogical deduction
to guide his followers when they were in doubt.
This analogical deduction has been the ruin of
Islām. Commentators and jurists have set their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii"></a>[Pg liii]</span>
nimble wits to work to extract from the Korān
legal decisions which an ordinary mind could
never discover there; and the whole structure of
modern Mohammadanism has been built upon
this foundation of sand. The Korān is not
responsible for it.</p>

<p>There is, however, another source of information
about Mohammad’s teaching and practice
which is largely responsible for the present form
of the once simple creed of Mekka. Besides the
public speeches which were held to be directly
inspired by God, and indeed copied from a book
supposed to exist in the handwriting of God,&mdash;the
chapters of the Korān,&mdash;there were many sayings
of Mohammad which were said in a private unofficial
way in his circle of intimate friends, and
which were almost as carefully treasured up as the
others. These are the Traditions, or as I may
call them, the Table-Talk of Mohammad, for they
correspond more nearly to what we mean by
table-talk than any other form of composition.
The Table-Talk of Mohammad deals with the
most minute and delicate circumstances of life, and
is much more serviceable to the lawyer than the
Korān itself. The sayings are very numerous and
very detailed; but how far they are genuine it is
not easy to determine. The Korān is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv"></a>[Pg liv]</span>
beyond any doubt to be at this moment, in all
practical respects, identical with the prophet’s
words as collected immediately after his death.
How it was edited and collected may be read
elsewhere. The only point to be here insisted on
is that its genuineness is above suspicion. Unfortunately,
as much cannot be said for the Traditions.
They were collected at a late period,
subjected to a totally useless and preposterous
criticism, and thus reduced from 600,000 to 7275,
without becoming in the least more trustworthy
in the process. It is almost impossible now to
sift them with any certainty. All we can go upon
is internal evidence, and a few obvious contradictions
in date&mdash;as when people relate things which
they apparently heard before they were born.
Beyond this, criticism is helpless, and all we can do
is what I have done here&mdash;to collect those which
strike the attention and do not seem peculiarly
improbable, and accept them provisionally as
possibly correct reports of Mohammad’s table-talk.
There are six standard collections of orthodox
traditions, but those on pp. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>-<a href="#Page_182">182</a> are taken
from an abridgment, the Mishkāt-el-Masābīh,
which Captain A. N. Matthews had the patience to
translate and publish at Calcutta in 1809. In the
midst of such doubt, they are sufficient for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv"></a>[Pg lv]</span>
purpose of illustration, without any pretence of
completeness or critical precision.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us banish from our minds
any conception of the Korān as a code of law, or
a systematic exposition of a creed. It is neither
of these. Let us only think of a simple enthusiast
confronted with many and varied difficulties, and
trying to meet them as best he could by the inward
light that guided him. The guidance was
not perfect, we know, and there is much that is
blameworthy in Mohammad; but whatever we
believe of him, let it be granted that his errors
were not the result of premeditated imposition, but
were the mistakes of an ignorant, impressible,
superstitious, but nevertheless noble and great
man.</p>

<p>In the <i>Introduction</i>, pp. xviii.-xxv. and xliv.-xlviii.,
appeared before in my Introduction to Lane’s <i>Selections
from the Kur-ān</i>, 2nd ed. (Trübner’s Oriental series,
1879), to which I must refer the reader for further information
on Mohammad and Islām, and especially concerning
the portions of the Korān dealing with the Jewish
legends purposely omitted from the present work. Pp.
xxxv.-xxxviii. reproduce a few paragraphs from the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, No. 316, October 1881, p. 371, ff. The
Arab poetry quoted in the Introduction is from the admirable
versions contributed by Mr. C. J. Lyall to the
Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1877 and 1881.
The description of Mohammad’s person and mode of life,
pp. xxvii.-xxix., is from E. Deutsch, <i>Literary Remains</i>,
p. 70, ff; and R. Bosworth Smith, <i>Mohammed and Mohammedanism</i>,
2d ed., p. 131; to which, and to the
Rev. E. Sell’s <i>Faith of Islam</i>, in many respects the best
treatise on the Mohammadan religion, as it now is, that
has appeared in recent years, the reader is referred for
much concerning modern and historical Mohammadanism
which is beyond the design of the present volume.</p>

<p>In the text, I must acknowledge my general indebtedness
to the versions of George Sale and the Rev. J. M.
Rodwell for many valuable interpretations; but I wish
especially to record my obligations to Prof. E. H.
Palmer, in respect of some fine renderings which he has
been the first to use in his translation of the Korān for

The two sins of the children of Israel and
their punishments. The Korān gives
promise of a great reward for righteousness
and an aching torment for disbelief.
Each man shall be judged by his own
deeds, and none shall be punished for
another’s sin; nor was any folk destroyed
without warning. Kindness and respect
to parents, and duty to kinsfolk and
travellers and the poor; hospitality, yet
without waste; faithfulness in engagements,
and honesty in trading, enjoined.
Idolatry, infanticide, inchastity, homicide
(except in a just cause and in fair retaliation),
and abusing orphans’ trust, and
pride, forbidden. The angels are not the
daughters of God: He has no partner,
and the whole creation worships Him.
But God hardens people’s hearts so that
they turn away from the Korān. The
Resurrection is nearer than they think.
The faithful must speak pleasantly and not
wrangle. Mohammad has no power to
compel belief. The false gods themselves
dread God’s torment. The power of
working miracles was not given to Mohammad,
because the people of yore always
disbelieved in them: so Thamūd
with the miraculous camel. The story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii"></a>[Pg lxiii]</span>
the devil’s original enmity to Adam; but
the devil cannot protect his followers
against God, to whom belongs all power
on land and sea, and whose is the Judgment.
Mohammad nearly tempted to
temporize. Prayer at sunset and dawn
and night vigils commended. Man’s insincerity.
The spirit sent from God.
The Korān inimitable. The demand for
miracles and for angelic messengers repudiated.
The fate of those who disbelieve
in the resurrection. Moses and
Pharaoh: the consequences of unbelief.
The Korān divided for convenience. The
solace of the faithful. God and the
Merciful the same deity.</td></tr>

<div class="verse0">A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful:&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">To warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and themselves are heedless.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Our word has proved true against the most of them; yet they will not believe!</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And it is all one to them whether thou warn them or warn them not: they will not believe.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Thou wilt only warn to good purpose him who followeth the monition and feareth the Merciful in secret: so tell him good tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And frame for them a parable&mdash;the people of the town [of Antioch], when the Apostles came to it;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">When we sent unto them two, and they called them liars; so we strengthened them with a third, and they said, “Verily we are sent unto you.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The people said, “Ye are only men like us; and the Merciful hath not revealed aught; in sooth ye are only lying.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They said, “Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And there is naught laid upon us but to announce a plain message.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The people said, “Of a truth we have drawn an evil augury from you: unless ye desist, we will surely stone you, and a painful punishment shall surely betide you from us.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They said, “Your evil augury is with yourselves! If ye be warned?&mdash;Nay! ye are an ignorant people.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And there came from the furthest part of the city a man running: he said, “O my people! follow the Apostles,</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Verily I believe in your Lord: therefore hear ye me.”&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It was said, “Enter into Paradise,” and he said, “Would that my people knew</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And afterwards we sent not down upon his people armies out of heaven nor what we were wont to send down:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It was but one shout, and lo, they were extinct!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">O the pity of men! No apostle cometh to them but they laugh him to scorn.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Do they not consider how many generations we have destroyed before them?</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Extolled be the glory of Him who hath created all sorts of what the earth beareth, and of men’s selves, and of that they know not of!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And a sign for them is the night. We draw away the day from it, and lo! they are in darkness;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the sun hasteneth to her resting-place.&mdash;This is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Wise!&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And for the moon we have decreed his mansions, till he is wasted to the likeness of a withered palm-branch.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It is not meet that the sun should overtake the moon, nor the night outstrip the day; but each doth swim in its sphere.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And it is a sign for them that we carry their offspring in the burthened ship;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And that we create for them the like of it to ride on;</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And when it is said to them, “Give alms of what God hath bestowed on you,” they who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we feed him whom God can feed if He pleases? verily ye are only in manifest error.”</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Saying, “Oh, woe is us! who hath roused us from our sleeping-place? This is what the Merciful threatened; and the apostles spake truth.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">There shall be but one blast, and, lo! all are arraigned before us;</div><!--verse-->

But they will say, “Who shall restore us?” Say: He who began you in the beginning! And they will wag their heads at thee and say, “When shall this be?” Say: Maybe it is nigh at hand.&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">A day when God shall summon you and ye shall answer with His praise; and ye shall think that ye have tarried but a little while.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
<div class="verse0">And say to my servants that they speak pleasantly: verily the Devil provoketh strife among them; verily the Devil is man’s open enemy.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Your Lord knoweth you well; if He please He will have mercy on you; or if He please He will torment you; and we have not sent thee to be our governor over them!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Thy Lord knoweth well who is in the heavens and in the earth. And we distinguished some of the prophets above others, and we gave to David the Psalms.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Call ye upon those whom ye profess beside Him; but they will have no power to put away trouble from you or alter it.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Those whom they invoke do themselves strive for access to their Lord, which of them shall be nearest: and they hope for His mercy and fear His torment: verily the torment of thy Lord is to be dreaded.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">There is no city but we will destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or torment it with grievous torment. That is written in the Book.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Nothing hindered our sending thee with signs but that the people of yore called them lies.

<div class="verse0">And when we said to thee, “Verily thy Lord encompasseth mankind;”&mdash;and we made the vision which we showed thee, and the accursed tree in the Korān, only to prove men; and we will terrify them; but it shall only add to their great disobedience.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when we said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam:” and they all bowed down save Iblīs: who said, “What! shall I bow down to him whom thou hast created of clay?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And said, “Dost thou consider this one whom thou hast honoured above me? Verily, if thou didst spare me till the day of Resurrection, I would utterly destroy his offspring, all but a few!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">God said, “Begone; but whosoever of them followeth thee, verily, Hell is to be your reward&mdash;reward enough!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And tempt whom thou canst of them by thy voice; and assail them with thy horsemen and thy footmen, and share with them in their riches and their children, and make them promises. (But the Devil’s promises are deceitful.)</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">It is your Lord who driveth your ships on the sea, that ye may seek of His abundance, verily He is merciful to you.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when a harm befalleth you at sea, they whom ye call on beside Him are missing! Then when He bringeth you safe to land, ye stand aloof: for man was ever thankless.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Are ye sure that He will not swallow you up on the shore, or send a sand-storm against you? then ye would not find for you any defender.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Or are ye sure that He will not turn you back again to sea, and send against you a storm of wind and drown you, because ye were thankless? Then shall ye find for yourselves no helper against us.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And we have honoured the sons of Adam; and we have borne them on the land and on the sea, and have fed them with good things, and distinguished them above many of our creatures.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And had we not prevented thee, thou hadst well-nigh inclined to them a little:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">In that case we would have made thee to taste of torment double in life and double in death, then should’st thou find for thyself no helper against us.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">And say: Truth is come and falsehood is fled away: verily falsehood is a fleeting thing.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And we send down from the Korān healing and mercy to the faithful; but it shall only add to the ruin of the wicked.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when we are gracious to man, he turneth away and standeth aloof; but when evil touches him he is in despair.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Every one doeth after his own fashion, but your Lord knoweth perfectly who is best guided on the road.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And they will ask thee of the Spirit; Say: The Spirit cometh at my Lord’s behest, and ye are given but scant knowledge.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And assuredly, if we pleased we could take away what we have revealed to thee: then wouldst thou not find for thyself a defender against us,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Save in mercy from thy Lord; verily His bounty towards thee is great.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Surely if mankind and the Jinn united in order to produce the like of this Korān, they could not produce its like, though they helped one another.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">We have varied every kind of parable for men in this Korān, but most men consent only to discredit it.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
<div class="verse0">And they say, “We will by no means believe in thee till thou makest a spring to gush forth for us from the earth;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Or till there cometh to thee a garden of palm-trees and grapes, and thou makest rivers to gush forth abundantly in its midst;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Or thou make the heaven to fall down in pieces upon us, as thou pretendest; or bring God and the angels before us;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend up into Heaven; and we will not believe in thy ascent until thou send down to us a book which we may read.” Say: Extolled be the glory of my Lord! Am I aught save a man, a messenger?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And nothing prevented men from believing, when the guidance came to them, but their saying, “Hath God sent a mere man as a messenger?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Had there been angels upon the earth walking at ease, we had surely sent them an angel from heaven as an apostle.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: God is witness enough between me and you: verily He knoweth and seeth His servants.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And whom God guideth, he is guided, and whom He misleadeth, thou shalt find him no protectors beside Him; and we will gather them on the day of Resurrection upon their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf, hell is their abode; so oft as its fire dieth down, we will stir up the flame.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
<div class="verse0">This is their reward, for that they believed not our signs, and said, “When we are become bones and dust, shall we indeed be raised a new creature?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Do they not see that God, who created the heavens and the earth is able to create their likes? and He hath made an appointed term for them: there is no doubt of it; but the wicked consent only to deny it!</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">Heretofore We brought to Moses nine evident signs: Ask then the Children of Israel [the story]&mdash;when he came unto them, and Pharaoh said unto him, “Verily I consider thee to be bewitched, O Moses.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He said, “Thou knowest that none hath sent these down as proofs but the Lord of the heavens and the earth; and verily I consider thee, O Pharaoh, accursed.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">So he sought to drive them out of the land; but we drowned him and those with him, every one.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
<div class="verse0">And after this we said to the Children of Israel, “Dwell ye in the land, and when the promise of the life to come befalleth, we will bring you in a troop to judgment.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And in truth have we sent down [the Korān], and in truth came it down, and we have sent thee only to give good tidings and to warn.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the Korān have we divided that thou mayest recite it unto men by degrees; and we have sent it down by [separate] sendings.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Believe ye therein or believe ye not;&mdash;those verily to whom knowledge hath been given before, when it is told to them, fall down on their faces in adoration, and say, “Extolled be the glory of our Lord! verily the promise of our Lord is accomplished.”</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0"><i>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</i></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">H. M. The revelation of the Book is from God the Mighty, the Wise,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Forgiver of sin, and accepter of repentance,&mdash;heavy in punishment,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Long-suffering: there is no God but He, to whom is your journeying.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">None dispute about the signs of God save those who disbelieve; but let not their trafficking in the land deceive thee.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Before them the people of Noah, and the allies after them, denied, and every folk hath purposed against its apostle to overmaster him, and they argued with falsehood to rebut the truth therewith; but I did overmaster them and how great was my punishment!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And thus was the sentence of thy Lord accomplished upon those who disbelieved, that they should be inmates of the Fire!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">They that bear the Throne and they that are round about it magnify the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and beg forgiveness for those who believe:&mdash;“O our Lord! thou embracest all things in mercy and knowledge, give pardon to those who repent and follow thy path, and keep them from the torment of hell,</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
<div class="verse0">O our Lord, and bring them into the gardens of eternity which thou hast promised to them and to the just among their fathers and their wives and their offspring; verily thou art the Mighty, the Wise;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And keep them from evil; for he whom thou keepest from evil on that day, on him hast thou had mercy&mdash;and that is the great prize!”</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Verily to those who disbelieve shall come a voice, “Surely the hatred of God is greater than your hatred among yourselves, when ye are called to the faith, and disbelieve.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They shall say, “O our Lord, twice hast thou given us death, and twice hast thou given us life: and we acknowledge our sins: is there then a way to escape?”&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">“That hath befallen you because when one God was proclaimed, ye disbelieved: but when Partners were ascribed to Him, ye believed: but judgment belongeth unto God, the High, the Great.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It is He who showeth you His signs, and sendeth down to you provision from heaven: but none mindeth except the repentant.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Then call on God with due obedience, though loth be the infidels;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Of high degree, Lord of the throne; He sendeth down the Spirit at His will upon whom He pleaseth of His servants to warn men of the day of the Tryst:&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The day when they shall come forth, and when nothing of theirs shall be hidden from God. Whose is the kingship on that day? It is God’s, the One, the Conqueror!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The day every soul shall be rewarded for what it hath earned: no injustice shall there be on that day! Verily God is swift to reckon.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And warn them of the approaching Day, when their hearts shall choke in their throats,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">When the wicked have no friend nor intercessor to prevail.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He knoweth the deceitful of eye, and what the breast concealeth,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And God judgeth with truth; but those gods whom they call on beside Him cannot judge aught. Verily it is God that heareth and seeth!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Have they not journeyed in the earth, and seen what was the end of those who were before them? Those were mightier than they in strength, and in their footprints on the earth: but God overtook them in their sins, and there was none to keep them from God.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
<div class="verse0">That was because apostles had come to them with manifestations, and they believed not: but God overtook them; verily He is strong and heavy in punishment.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">We sent Moses of old with our signs and with plain authority,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">To Pharaoh, and Haman, and Korah: and they said, “A lying wizard.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when he came to them with truth from us they said, “Slay the sons of those who believe with them, and spare their women;” but the plot of the unbelievers was at fault:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Pharaoh said, “Let me alone to kill Moses; and let him call upon his Lord: verily I fear lest he change your religion, or cause iniquity in the earth.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Moses said, “Verily I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every one puffed up who believeth not in the day of reckoning.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And there spake a man of the family of Pharaoh, a <span class="smcap">Believer</span>, who concealed his faith, “Will ye kill a man because he saith my Lord is God, when he hath come unto you with manifestations from your Lord? for if he be a liar, upon him alone is his lie, but if he be a man of truth, somewhat of that which he threateneth will befall you. Verily God guideth not him who is an outrageous liar.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
<div class="verse0">O my people, to-day is the kingdom yours who are uppermost in the earth! but who will defend us against the might of God if it come upon us?” Pharaoh said, “I will only show you what I think, and I will not guide you save in a right way.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then said he who believed, “O my people, verily I fear for you the like of the day of the allies,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The like of the state of the people of Noah, and Ad, and Thamūd,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And of those who came after them; and God willeth not injustice to His servants.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And, O my people! verily I fear for you the day of crying out:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The day when ye shall turn your backs in flight, ye shall have no protector against God; and he whom God misleads, no guide has he.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Moreover, Joseph came unto you before with manifestations; but ye ceased not to doubt about [the message] he brought you, until when he died ye said, ‘God will by no means send an apostle after him.’ Thus God misleadeth him who is an outrageous doubter.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
<div class="verse0">They who dispute about the signs of God, and no proof coming to them, are very hateful to God and to those who believe. Thus God sealeth the heart of all who are puffed up and arrogant.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Pharaoh said, “O Haman, build me a tower, mayhap I shall reach the avenues,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The avenues of the heavens, and may ascend to the God of Moses: but verily I hold him a liar.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And thus the wickedness of his deed seemed good to Pharaoh, and he was turned away from the right path; but the plot of Pharaoh only came to ruin.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And he who believed said, “O my people, follow me: I will guide you the right way.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">O my people, the life of this world is but a passing joy; but the life to come, that is the abode imperishable.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Whosoever doeth evil shall not be rewarded save with its like; and whosoever doeth right, whether male or female, being a believer&mdash;these shall enter paradise; and be provided therein without count.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
<div class="verse0">And O my people! how is it that I bid you to salvation, but that ye bid me to the Fire?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Ye call me to disbelieve in God and join to Him that of which I have no knowledge: and I call you to the Mighty, the Very Forgiving.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">There is no doubt but that those ye call me to are not to be called on in this world or in the world to come, and that we shall return unto God, and the transgressors shall be inmates of the Fire.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then shall ye call to mind what I said to you: and I commit my case to God: verily God regardeth His servants.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">So God kept him from the evil which they devised, and there encompassed the people of Pharaoh the woeful torment&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The Fire, to which they shall be exposed morning and evening; and on the day when the Hour cometh&mdash;“Enter, ye people of Pharaoh, into the sorest torment.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when they shall wrangle together in the fire, the feeble shall say to those who were puffed up, “Verily we followed you: will ye then remove from us aught of the Fire?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And those who were puffed up will say, “Verily we are all in it. Behold! God hath judged between His servants.”</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
<div class="verse0">And they who are in the Fire shall say to the keepers of Hell, “Call on your Lord, that He remit us one day from the torment.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">The keepers shall say, “Did there not come to you your apostles with manifestations?” They shall say, “Yea.” The keepers shall say, “Call then,” but the cry of the unbelievers shall be vain.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Verily we will help our apostles and those who believe, both in the life of this world and on the day when the witness shall stand forth;&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">A day whereon the excuse of the wicked shall not profit them; but they shall have the curse and the abode of woe.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And of old gave we Moses the guidance, and the Children of Israel made we heirs of the Book,&mdash;a guidance and a warning to those who have understanding.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Be patient, therefore; verily the promise of God is true; and seek pardon for thy sins, and magnify the praises of thy Lord at eve and early morn.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily those who dispute about the signs of God, without proof reaching them, there is naught in their breasts but pride: and they shall not win. But seek refuge with God; verily, He heareth and seeth.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Surely the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of man. But most men do not know.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Moreover the blind and the seeing are not equal, nor the sinner and they who believe and do the things that are right;&mdash;little do they mind!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily the Hour is assuredly coming: there is no doubt of it;&mdash;but most men do not believe.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And your Lord saith, “Call upon me;&mdash;I will hearken unto you: but as to those who are too puffed up for my service, they shall enter Hell in contempt.”</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">It is God who made you the night to rest in, and the day for seeing: verily God is bounteous to man, but most men are not thankful.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">That is God your Lord, Creator of all things: there is no god but He: then why do ye turn away?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Thus do they turn away who gainsay the signs of God&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">God, who made you the earth for a resting-place and the heaven for a tent, and formed you and made goodly your forms and provided you with good things&mdash;that is God, your Lord.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He is the Living One. No god is there but He! then call upon Him, purifying your service to Him. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
<div class="verse0">Say: Verily I am forbidden to serve those whom ye call on beside God, since there came to me manifestations from my Lord, and I am bidden to resign myself to the Lord of the worlds.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He it is who created you of dust, then of a germ, then of blood; then bringeth you forth a babe: then ye come to your strength, then ye become old men (but some of you die before) and reach the appointed term: haply ye will understand!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It is He who giveth life and death; and when He decreeth a thing, He only saith to it, “Be,” and it is.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Hast thou not beheld those who cavil at the signs of God, how they are turned aside?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They who call the Book, and that with which we have sent our apostles, a lie: they shall soon know!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">When the shackles shall be on their necks, and the chains, whilst they are dragged into Hell&mdash;then in the fire shall they be burned&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then shall it be said to them, “Where is that which ye joined in worship beside God?” They shall say, “They are lost to us, Nay! we did not call before upon anything.” Thus God misleadeth the unbelievers.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
<div class="verse0">“That is because ye exulted on earth in what was not true, and because ye were insolent.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein for ever: and wretched is the abode of the proud!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">But be thou patient: verily the promise of God is true: and whether we show thee part of what we threatened them, or whether we make thee to die; yet to us shall they return.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">We have sent apostles before thee. Of some we have told thee and of some we have not told thee: but no apostle was able to bring a sign unless by the permission of God. But when God’s behest cometh, everything is decided with truth: and those perish who think it vain.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">It is God who hath made for you the cattle, some to ride and some to eat,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">(And ye have profit from them) and to attain by them the aims of your hearts, for on them and in ships are ye borne:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And He showeth you His signs: which then of the signs of God will ye deny?</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
<div class="verse0">Have they not journeyed in the earth, and seen what was the end of those who were before them? They were in number more than they, and mightier in strength, and in their footprints on the earth: but what they had earned availed them nothing;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when their apostles came to them with manifestations, they exulted in what knowledge they had; but that which they had scoffed at encompassed them.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when they beheld our might they said, “We believe in God alone, and we disbelieve in what we joined in worship with Him.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And naught availed their faith, after they witnessed our might. Such the way of God which was reserved for his servants&mdash;and therein the unbelievers have lost.</div><!--verse-->

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">A. L. R. These are the signs of the wise Book!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Is it a matter of wonder to the people that we revealed to a man from among themselves, “Warn the people; and bring good tidings to those who believe, that the reward of their good faith is with their Lord?” The unbelievers say, “Lo! this is an evident sorcerer!”</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Verily your Lord is God, who made the heavens and the earth in six days&mdash;then ascended the throne to govern all things: there is none to plead with Him save by His permission.&mdash;This is God, your Lord! then worship ye Him: will ye not mind?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Unto Him shall ye all return by the sure promise of God: behold! He produces a creature, then maketh it return again, that He may reward with equity those who believe and do the things that are right: but those who believe not, for them is the scalding drink, and an aching torment&mdash;because they did not believe.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
<div class="verse0">It is He who hath made the sun for shining, and the moon for light, and ordained him mansions that ye may learn the number of years and the reckoning of time. God did not create that but in truth. He maketh His signs plain to a people who know.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily in the alterations of the night and the day, and in all that God created in the heavens and the earth, are signs to a godfearing folk.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Verily they who do not hope to meet us, and are satisfied with the life of this world, and are content with it, and they who are careless of our signs,&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Their dwelling-place is the Fire, for what they have earned.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily they who believe and do the things that are right, their Lord shall guide them because of their faith; beneath them rivers shall flow in gardens of delight:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Their cry therein shall be, “Extolled be thy glory, O God!” and their salutation therein shall be “Peace!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And the end of their cry shall be, “Praise to God, Lord of the worlds!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And if God should hasten woe upon men as they fain would hasten weal, verily their appointed term is decreed for them! therefore we leave those who hope not to meet us groping in their disobedience.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
<div class="verse0">Moreover, when affliction toucheth man, he calleth us upon his side, sitting, or standing; and when we take away his affliction from him, he passeth on as though he had not called us in the affliction that touched him! Thus do the deeds of transgressors seem good to them!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">We have destroyed generations before you, when they sinned and their apostles came to them with manifestations and they would not believe;&mdash;thus do we requite the sinful folk.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then we made you their successors in the earth after them, to see how ye would act.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">But when our manifest signs are recited to them, they who hope not to meet us say, “Bring a different Korān from this, or change it.” Say: It is not for me to change it of mine own will. I follow only what is revealed to me: verily I fear if I disobey my Lord the torment of the great Day.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: If God pleased, I had not recited it to you nor taught it you; and already I had dwelt a lifetime amongst you before that: have ye then no wits?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And who is more wicked than he who forgeth a lie against God, or saith His signs are lies? Surely the sinners shall not prosper!</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
<div class="verse0">And they worship beside God that which cannot hurt them or help them; and they say, “These shall be our pleaders with God.” Say: Will ye tell God of anything He doth not know in the heavens and in the earth? Extolled be His glory! and far be He above what they associate with Him!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Men were of only one religion: then they differed, and had not a decree gone forth from thy Lord, there had certainly been made a decision between them of that whereon they differed.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And they say, “Had a sign been sent down to him from his Lord ...”&mdash;but say: The unseen is with God alone: wait, therefore; verily I am waiting with you.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when we caused men to taste of mercy after affliction had touched them, behold! they have a plot against our signs! Say: God is quick at plotting! verily our messengers write down what ye plot.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">He it is who maketh you journey by land and sea, until, when ye are in ships&mdash;and they run with them before a fair wind, and they rejoice thereat, there cometh upon them a violent wind, and the waves come upon them from every side, and they suppose they are sore pressed therewith; they call on God, offering Him sincere religion:&mdash;“Do thou but deliver us from this, and we will indeed be of the thankful.”</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
<div class="verse0">But when we have delivered them, lo, they transgress unjustly on the earth! O ye people! ye wrong your own souls only for the enjoyment of the life of this world: then to us shall ye return; and we will tell you what ye have done.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">The likeness of the life of this world is as the water which we send down from the heaven, and there mingleth with it the produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat, until when the earth hath put on its blazonry and is arrayed, and its inhabitants think it is they who ordain it, our command cometh to it by night or day, and we make it mown down, as if it had not teemed yesterday! Thus do we explain our signs to a reflecting folk.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And God calleth you unto the abode of peace: and guideth whom He will into the straight way:</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
<div class="verse0">To those who have done well, weal and to spare,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Neither blackness shall cover their faces nor shame! these are the inmates of Paradise, to abide therein for ever.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And as for those who have earned evil, the recompense of evil is its like; shame shall cover them&mdash;no defender shall they have against God&mdash;as though their faces were darkened with the gloom of night: these are the inmates of the Fire to abide therein for ever.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And on the day we will gather them all together, then will we say to those who made Partners with God, “To your place, ye and your Partners!” and we will separate between them; and their partners shall say, “Ye worshipped not us,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And God is witness enough between us and you that we were indifferent to your worship!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then shall every soul make proof of what it hath sent on before, and they shall be brought back to God their true Master, and what they devised shall vanish from them.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Say: Who provideth you from the heaven and the earth? who is king over hearing and sight? and who bringeth forth the living from the dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living? and who ruleth all things? And they shall say, “God:” then say: Do ye not fear?</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
<div class="verse0">So that is God your true Lord: and after the truth, what is there but error? How then are ye turned away?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Thus is the word of thy Lord fulfilled upon those who work iniquity: they shall not believe.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Is there any of the Partners [of God] who can produce a creature, then bring it back again? Say: God produceth a creature then bringeth it back again: how then are ye deceived?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Is there any of the Partners who guideth to the truth? Say: God guideth unto the truth. Is he who guideth to the truth the worthier to be followed, or he who guideth not except he be guided? What is in you so to judge?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And most of them only follow a fancy: but a fancy profiteth nothing against the truth! verily God knoweth what they do.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Moreover this Korān could not have been devised without God: but it confirmeth what preceded it, and explaineth the Scripture&mdash;there is no doubt therein&mdash;from the Lord of the worlds.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Do they say, “He hath devised it himself?” Say: Then bring a chapter like it: and call on whom ye can beside God, if ye be speakers of truth.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
<div class="verse0">Nay, they call all that a lie, of which they compass not the knowledge, though the explanation of it hath not yet been given them; so did those who were before them call the Scriptures lies: but see what was the end of the wicked!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And some of them believe in it, and some of them believe not in it. But thy Lord knoweth best about the evildoers.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And if they call thee a liar, say, I have my work, and ye have your work: ye are clear of what I work, and I am clear of what ye work.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And some of them hearken to thee; but canst thou make the deaf hear if they have no wits?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And some of them regard thee; but canst thou guide the blind when they see not?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily God doth not wrong man a whit, but men wrong themselves.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And on a day He will gather them, as though they had tarried but an hour of the day: they shall know one another! They are lost who denied the meeting with God and were not guided!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Whether we show thee part of what we threatened against them, or whether we take thee to ourself [before], to us is their return&mdash;then shall God be witness of what they have done.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
<div class="verse0">And every nation hath its apostle; and when their apostle is come, it is decided between them with equity, and they are not wronged.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Yet they say, “When will this promise be, if ye be speakers of truth?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: I have no power for myself for woe or weal, except as God pleaseth. Every people hath its appointed term: when their term is come, they shall not put it off nor hasten it an hour.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Bethink ye, if the torment of God come upon you by night or by day, what portion of it will the sinners willingly hasten on?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">When it happeneth, will ye believe it then? Yet would ye fain hasten it on!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then shall it be said to those who transgressed, “Taste ye the torment of eternity! Shall ye be rewarded save according to what ye have earned?”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They would fain know of thee if this is true. Say: Yea, by my Lord, it is indeed true, and ye cannot weaken Him.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And if every soul that transgressed owned all that is on earth, he would assuredly give it in ransom; and they will declare their repentance when they have seen the torment: and there shall be a decision between them with equity, and they shall not be wronged.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
<div class="verse0">Is not indeed whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth God’s? Is not indeed the promise of God true? But most of them do not know!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">He giveth life and death, and to Him shall ye return.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">O ye people! now hath a warning come to you from your Lord, and a healing for what is in your breasts, and a guidance and a mercy to the believers.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: By the grace of God and his mercy! And in that let them therefore rejoice: this is better than what they heap up.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Do ye consider what God hath sent down to you for provision: but ye made thereof unlawful and lawful? Say, did God permit you? or do ye forge against God?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">But what will they think on the day of resurrection who forge a lie against God? Truly God is full of bounty towards man; but most of them are not thankful.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Thou shalt not be in any business, and thou shalt not read from the Korān, and ye shall not do any deed, but we are witness against you when ye are engaged therein; and there escapeth not thy Lord an ant’s weight in earth or in heaven: and there is nothing lesser or greater than that, but it is in the plain Book.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
<div class="verse0">Are not they truly the friends of God on whom is no fear neither are they sorrowful&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They who believed and feared God,&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">For them are good tidings in the life of this world, and in the life to come there is no changing in God’s sentences. That is the great prize!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And let not their discourse grieve thee: verily all power belongeth to God, He it is who heareth and knoweth.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Doth not whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth belong to God? then what do they follow who call upon Partners beside God? verily they follow but a fancy; and verily they are naught but liars.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It is He who made you the night to rest in, and the day for seeing: verily in that are signs to a folk that can hear!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">They say, “God hath taken him a son.” Extolled be his glory! He is the Self-sufficient, all that is in the heavens, and all that is in the earth is his! ye have no warranty for this! do ye say about God that which ye know not?</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
<div class="verse0">Say: Verily they who forge this lie against God shall not prosper:&mdash;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">A passing joy in this world, then to us they return; and then we will make them taste the grievous torment, because they did not believe.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And tell them the story of Noah, when he said to his people,&mdash;“O my people! though my dwelling with you and my warning you of the signs of God hath been grievous to you, yet in God do I put my trust: so gather together your case and your Partners; then will not your case fall upon you in the dark: then decide about me and delay not.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And if ye turn, yet ask I no reward from you: my reward is with God alone, and I am commanded to be of those who are resigned.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">But they called him a liar, so we delivered him and those who were with him in the ship, and we made them to survive; and we drowned those who had called our signs lies: see then what was the end of those who were warned!</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">Then after him, we sent apostles to their people, and they came to them with manifestations: but they would not believe in what they had denied before: thus do we put a seal upon the hearts of the transgressors.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
<div class="verse0">Then sent we, after them, Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nobles with our signs; but they were puffed up and were a sinful folk.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when the truth came to them from us, they said, “This is clear sorcery indeed.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Moses said, “Say ye of the truth when it is come to you, Is this sorcery?&mdash;but sorcerers shall not prosper.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">They said, “Art thou come to us to hinder us from what we found our fathers in, and in order that for you twain there shall be majesty in the land? but we are not going to believe in you!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Pharaoh said, “Fetch me every wise sorcerer.” And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, “Cast down what ye have to cast.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And when they had cast them down, Moses said, “What ye come with is sorcery: verily God will make it vain; aye, God doth not prosper the work of evildoers;</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And God will establish the truth by his word, though loth be the sinners.”</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
<div class="verse0">And none believed in Moses but the children of his own folk, for fear of Pharaoh and his nobles, lest he should afflict them: for of a truth Pharaoh was mighty in the earth, and verily he was of the transgressors.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Moses said, “O my people! if ye believe in God, put your trust in Him, if ye are resigned.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And they said, “In God do we put our trust. O our Lord, make us not a trial to the folk of the wicked,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And deliver us in Thy mercy from the folk of the unbelievers.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then revealed we to Moses and to his brother: “Build houses for your people in Egypt, and make your houses with a Kibla, and perform prayer, and give good tidings to the believers.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And Moses said, “O our Lord, thou hast indeed given to Pharaoh and his nobles adornments and riches in the life of this world: O our Lord! may they err from thy way; O our Lord, confound their riches, and harden their hearts, so shall they not believe until they see the aching torment.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">God said: “Your prayer is heard, then stand ye upright, and follow not the path of those who know not.”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And we brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh and his host followed them, eager and hostile, until when drowning overtook him he said, “I believe that there is no God but He in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of the resigned.”</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
<div class="verse0">“Now! thou hast been rebellious aforetime, and wast one of the evildoers,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">This day will we raise thee in thy flesh, to be a sign to those who come after thee: but verily many men are heedless of our signs!”</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Moreover we lodged the Children of Israel in a firm abode, and provided them with good things: and they did not differ until the knowledge came to them; verily thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that on which they differed.</div><!--verse-->
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse0">And if thou art in doubt of what we have sent down to thee, inquire of those who read the Scriptures before thee. Now hath truth come unto thee from thy Lord: then be not thou of those who doubt,</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Neither be of those who deny the signs of God lest thou be among the losers.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Verily they against whom the word of thy Lord is passed shall not believe,&mdash;</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
<div class="verse0">Though there came unto them every kind of sign,&mdash;till they behold the aching torment.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Else any city had believed, and its faith had benefited it:&mdash;save the people of <span class="smcap">Jonah</span>; when they believed, we took away from them the torment of shame in the life of this world, and provided for them awhile.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">But if thy Lord pleased, verily all who are in the earth had believed together. Then canst thou compel men to become believers?</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">It is not in a soul to believe but by the permission of God: and He shall lay His curse on those who have no wits.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: Look upon that which is in the heavens and in the earth: but signs and warners avail not a folk that will not believe!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">What then can they expect but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say: Wait ye,&mdash;I too am waiting with you.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Then will we deliver our apostles and those who believe: thus is it binding on us to deliver the faithful.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: O ye people! if ye are in doubt of my religion, I do not worship those whom ye worship beside God; but I worship God, who taketh you away; and I am commanded to be of the faithful.</div><!--verse--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
<div class="verse0">And set thy face towards religion as a Hanīf, and be not of those idolaters:</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And invoke not beside God that which can neither help nor hurt; for if thou do, thou wilt certainly be of the wicked.</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And if God touch thee with affliction, there is none to remove it but He. And if He desire thy good, there is none to hinder His bounty&mdash;He will confer it on whom He pleaseth of his servants: and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">Say: O ye people! now hath truth come unto you from your Lord; then he who is guided, is guided only for his own behoof: but he who erreth doth err only against himself; and I am no governor over you!</div><!--verse-->
<div class="verse0">And follow what is revealed to thee: and be patient till God judgeth; and He is the best of judges.</div><!--verse-->

<div class="verse0">It is God who raised the heavens without pillars that ye can see; then ascended the Throne, and subdued the sun and the moon: each runneth to its appointed goal, to rule every thing, to manifest signs. Haply ye will be convinced of meeting your Lord!</div><!--verse-->

For those who respond to their Lord, good; but those who respond not to Him, had they all that the earth containeth and its like beside it, they would surely give it in ransom: these shall have an evil reckoning, and Hell shall be their home,&mdash;and wretched the bed!</div><!--verse-->

<p>It is not righteousness that ye turn your face
towards the east or the west, but righteousness is
[in] him who believeth in God and the Last Day,
and the Angels, and the Scripture, and the
Prophets, and who giveth wealth for the love of
God to his kinsfolk and to orphans and the
needy and the son of the road and them that
ask and for the freeing of slaves, and who is
instant in prayer, and giveth the alms; and those
who fulfil their covenant when they covenant, and
the patient in adversity and affliction and in time
of violence, these are they who are true, and these
are they who fear God.&mdash;ii. 172.</p>

<p>Say: We believe in God, and what hath been
sent down to thee, and what was sent down to
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and
the tribes, and what was given to Moses, and to
Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord,&mdash;we
make no distinction between any of them,&mdash;and

other than Resignation [Islām] for a religion, it

<p>Observe the prayers, and the middle prayer,
and stand instant before God. And if ye fear,
then afoot or mounted; but when ye are safe
remember God, how he taught you what ye did not
know.&mdash;ii. 239, 240.</p>

<p>When the call to prayer soundeth on the Day
of Congregation (Friday), then hasten to remember
God, and abandon business; that is better for
you if ye only knew: and when prayer is done,
disperse in the land and seek of the bounty of
God.&mdash;lxii. 9, 10.</p>

<p>Turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque;
wherever ye be, turn your faces thitherwards.&mdash;ii.
139.</p>

<p>Give alms on the path of God, and let not
your hands cast you into destruction; but do good,
for God loveth those who do good; and accomplish
the pilgrimage and the visit to God: but if
ye be besieged, then [send] what is easiest as an
offering.&mdash;ii. 191.</p>

<p>They will ask thee what it is they must give in
alms. Say: Let what good ye give be for parents,
and kinsfolk, and the orphan, and the needy, and
the son of the road; and what good ye do, verily
God knoweth it.&mdash;ii. 211.</p>

<p>They will ask thee what they shall expend in
alms; say, The surplus.&mdash;ii. 216.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>If ye give alms openly, it is well; but if ye conceal
it, and give it to the poor, it is better for you,
and will take away from you some of your sins:
and God knoweth what ye do.&mdash;ii. 273.</p>

<p>O ye who believe, make not your alms of no
effect by taunts and vexation, like him who spendeth
what he hath to be seen of men, and believeth not
in God and the Last Day: for his likeness is as
the likeness of a stone with earth upon it, and a
heavy rain falleth upon it and leaveth it bare;
they accomplish nothing with what they earn, for
God guideth not the people that disbelieve. And
the likeness of those who expend their wealth for
the sake of pleasing God and for the certainty of
their souls is as the likeness of a garden on a hill:
a heavy rain falleth on it and it bringeth forth its
fruit twofold; and if no heavy rain falleth on it,
then the dew falleth; and God seeth what ye do.&mdash;ii.
266, 267.</p>

<p>Kind speech and forgiveness is better than
alms which vexation followeth; and God is rich
and ruthful.&mdash;ii. 265.</p>

<p>O ye who believe, there is prescribed for you
the fast as it was prescribed for those before you;
maybe ye will fear God for a certain number of
days, but he amongst you who is sick or on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
journey may fast a [like] number of other days.
And for those who are able to fast [and do not],
the expiation is feeding a poor man; but he who
voluntarily doeth a good act, it is better for
him; and to fast is better for you, if ye only knew.
The month of Ramadān, wherein the Korān was
sent down for guidance to men, and for proofs of
the guidance, and the distinguishing [of good and
evil]; whoso amongst you seeth this month, let
him fast it; but he who is sick or on a journey, a
[like] number of other days:&mdash;God wisheth for
you what is easy, and wisheth not for you what is
difficult&mdash;that ye may fulfil the number, and magnify
God, in that He hath guided you;&mdash;and maybe
ye will be thankful.&mdash;ii. 179-181.</p>

<p>Proclaim among the people a Pilgrimage: let
them come to thee on foot and on every fleet camel,
coming by every deep pass, to be present at its
benefits to them, and to make mention of God’s
name at the appointed days over the beasts with
which He hath provided them: then eat thereof,
and feed the poor and needy; then let them end
the neglect of their persons, and pay their vows,
and make the circuit of the ancient House.&mdash;xxii.

<p>He only shall visit the Mosques of God who
believeth in God and the Last Day, and is instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
in prayer, and payeth the alms, and feareth God
only.&mdash;ix. 18.</p>

<p>Do ye place the giving drink to the pilgrims,
and the visiting of the Sacred Mosque, on the same
level with him who believeth in God and the Last
Day, and fighteth on the path of God? They are
not equal in the sight of God.&mdash;ix. 19.</p>

<p>Fight in the path of God with those who fight
with you;&mdash;but exceed not; verily God loveth
not those who exceed.&mdash;And kill them wheresoever
ye find them, and thrust them out from whence
they thrust you out; for dissent is worse than
slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred
Mosque, unless they fight you there: but if they
fight you, then kill them: such is the reward
of the infidels! But if they desist, then verily
God is forgiving and merciful.&mdash;But fight them till
there be no dissent, and the worship be only to
God;&mdash;but, if they desist, then let there be no
hostility save against the transgressors.&mdash;ii. 186-189.</p>

<p>They will ask thee of the sacred month, and
fighting therein; say, Fighting therein is a great
sin; but turning people away from God’s path, and
disbelief in Him and in the Sacred Mosque, and
turning His people out therefrom, is a greater in
God’s sight, and dissent is a greater sin than
slaughter.&mdash;ii. 214.</p>

<p>Forbidden to you is that which dieth of itself,

is dedicated to other than God, and what is
strangled, and what is killed by a blow, or by
falling, and what is gored, and what wild beasts
have preyed on&mdash;except what ye kill in time&mdash;and
what is sacrificed to idols; and to divide by [the
divination of] arrows, that is transgression in you.&mdash;v.

the means, then let him fast for two consecutive

<p>Divorce may be twice: then take them in

half; and for the parents, for each of them a sixth

hath no issue, and his parents inherit, then let his
mother have a third; and if he hath brethren, let
his mother have a sixth, after payment of any
bequest he may have bequeathed, or debts. Your
parents and your children, ye know not which is
the more helpful to you. An ordinance from God:
verily God is all-knowing and wise! And yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
is half of what your wives leave, if they have no
issue; but if they have issue, then ye shall have
a fourth of what they leave, after payment of any
bequests they may bequeath, or their debts; and
they shall have a fourth of what ye leave, if ye
have no issue; but if ye have issue, then let
them have an eighth of what ye leave, after paying
of any bequest ye may bequeath, or debts.
And if the man’s or the woman’s heir be a collateral
kinsman, and he (or she) have a brother or a
sister, then let each of these two have a sixth;
but if they are more than that, let them share
a third, after payment of any bequests he may
bequeath, or debts, without prejudice; an ordinance
from God, and God is wise and clement!</p>

<p>These are God’s statutes, and whoso obeyeth
God and the Apostle, He will bring him into
gardens, whereunder rivers flow, to abide therein
for aye,&mdash;that is the great prize! But whoso
rebelleth against God and his Apostle, and transgresseth
His statutes, He will bring him into fire,
to dwell therein for aye; and his shall be a
shameful torment.&mdash;iv. 12-18.</p>

<p>Those of you who die and leave wives, should
leave their wives maintenance for a year, without
driving them out [from their homes]: but if they
go out, there is no crime in you for what they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
for themselves in reason; and God is mighty and
wise.&mdash;ii. 241.</p>

<p>If a man perish and leave no issue, but leave a
sister, then hers is half of what he leaves, and he
shall be her heir, if she have no issue; but if there
be two sisters, let them have two-thirds of what
he leaves, and if there be brethren, both men and
women, let the male have the equal of the portion
of two females. God maketh this plain to you,
lest ye err; and God knoweth all things.&mdash;iv. 176.</p>

<p>O ye who believe! stand fast by justice, bearing
witness before God, though it be against
yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred,
whether it be rich or poor; for God is worthier

<p>To those of your slaves who desire a deed [for
buying their freedom], write it for them, if ye know
good in them, and give them a portion of the

<p>If any of the idolaters seek refuge with thee,
grant him refuge, that he may hear the word of God;
then let him reach his place in safety.&mdash;ix. 6.</p>

<p>God wisheth to make it light for you, for man
was created weak.&mdash;iv. 32.</p>

<p>If ye shun great sins which ye are forbidden,
we will cover your offences, and make you enter

cutting wood, and selling it; and he came to the

“I shall stay here, and retire from the world.”
Then he asked the Prophet’s permission to live in
the cavern; but he said, “Verily I have not been
sent on the Jewish religion, nor the Christian, to
quit the delights of society; but I have been sent
on the religion inclining to truth, and that which
is easy, wherein is no difficulty or austerity. I
swear by God, in whose hand is my life, that
marching about morning and evening to fight for
religion is better than the world and everything

in the line of battle is better than supererogatory
prayers performed in your house for sixty years.”</p>

he would say, March in the name of God and

return. And I said, “What is this?” They said,
“Advance,” and we moved forward, till we arrived
at a green garden, in which was a large tree, and
an old man and children sitting on the roots of
it, and near it was a man lighting a fire. Then I
was carried upon the tree, and put into a house
which was in the middle of it,&mdash;a better house I
have never seen: and there were old men, young
men, women, and children. After that they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
me out of the house and carried me to the top of
the tree, and put me into a better house, where
were old men and young men. And I said to my
two conductors, “Verily ye have shown me a great
many things to-night, then inform me of what I
have seen.” They said, “Yes: as to the man whom
you saw with split lips, he was a liar, and will be
treated in that way till the Day of Resurrection;
and the person you saw getting his head broken
is a man whom God taught the Korān, and he
did not repeat it in the night, nor practice what is
in it by day, and he will be treated as you saw till
the Day of Resurrection; and the people you saw
in the oven are adulterers; and those you saw in
the river are receivers of usury; and the old man
you saw under the tree is Abraham; and the
children around them are the children of men:
and the person who was lighting the fire was
Mālik, the keeper of hell; and the first house you
entered was for the common believers; and as to
the second house, it is for the martyrs: and we
who conducted you are one of us Gabriel, and the
other Michael; then raise up your head;” and I
did so, and saw above it as it were a cloud: and they
said, “That is your dwelling.” I said, “Call it
here, that I may enter it;” and they said, “Verily
your life remaineth, but when you have completed
it, you will come into your house.”</p>

<p>When God created Paradise, He said to Gabriel,
“Go and look at it,” then Gabriel went and looked
at it and at the things which God had prepared
for the people of it. After that Gabriel came and
said, “O my Lord! I swear by thy glory no one
will hear a description of Paradise but will be
ambitious of entering it.” After that God surrounded
Paradise with distress and troubles, and
said, “O Gabriel, go and look at Paradise.”
And he went and looked, and then returned and
said, “O my Lord, I fear that verily no one will
enter it.” And when God created Hell Fire He
said to Gabriel, “Go and take a look at it.” And
he went and looked at it, and returned and said,
“O my Lord, I swear by thy glory that no one
who shall hear a description of Hell Fire will
wish to enter it.” Then God surrounded it with
sins, desires, and vices, after that said to Gabriel,
“Go and look at Hell Fire,” and he went and
looked at it, and said, “O my Lord, I swear by
thy glory I am afraid that every one will enter
Hell, because sins are so sweet that there is none
but will incline to them.”</p>

<p>Then I said, “O messenger of God! shall we
perish while the virtuous are amongst us?” He
said, Yes, when the wickedness shall be excessive,
verily there will be tribes of my sects that will
consider the wearing of silks and drinking liquor
lawful, and will listen to the lute: and there will
be men with magnificent houses, and their milch
animals will come to them in the evening, full of
milk, and a man will come begging a little and
they will say, Come to-morrow. Then God will
quickly send a punishment upon them, and will
change others into the shape of monkeys and
swine, unto the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Verily among the signs of the Resurrection
will be the taking away of knowledge from amongst
men; and their being in great ignorance and
much wickedness and much drinking of liquor, and
diminution of men, and there being many women;
to such a degree that there will be fifty women to
one man, and he will work for a livelihood for
the women.</p>

<p>The hearts of men are at the disposal of God

<p>The first thing which God created was a pen,
and He said to it, “Write.” It said, “What shall I
write?” And God said, “Write down the quantity
of every separate thing to be created.” And it
wrote all that was and all that will be to eternity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is not one among you whose sitting-place
is not written by God whether in the fire or in
Paradise. The Companions said, “O Prophet!
since God hath appointed our place, may we confide
in this and abandon our religious and moral
duty?” He said, “No, because the happy will
do good works, and those who are of the miserable
will do bad works.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prophet of God said that Adam and
Moses (in the world of spirits) maintained a debate
before God, and Adam got the better of
Moses; who said, “Thou art that Adam whom
God created by the power of His hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
breathed into thee from His own spirit, and made
the angels bow before thee, and gave thee an
habitation in His own Paradise: after that
thou threwest man upon the earth, from the fault
which thou committedst.” Adam said, “Thou art
that Moses whom God elected for His prophecy,
and to converse with, and He gave to thee twelve
tables, in which are explained everything, and God
made thee His confidant, and the bearer of His
secrets: then how long was the Bible written
before I was created?” Moses said, “Forty
years.” Then Adam said, “Didst thou see in the
Bible that Adam disobeyed God?” He said,
“Yes.” Adam said, “Dost thou then reproach
me on a matter which God wrote in the Bible
forty years before creating me?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Aïsha relates that the Prophet said to her,
“Do you know, O 'Aïsha! the excellence of
this night?” (the fifteenth of Ramadān.) I said,
“What is it, O Prophet?” He said, “One thing
in this night is, that all the children of Adam to
be born in the year are written down; and also
those who are to die in it, and all the actions
of the children of Adam are carried up to heaven
in this night; and their allowances are sent down.”
Then I said, “O Prophet, do none enter Paradise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
except by God’s mercy?” He said, “No, none
enter except by God’s favour:” this he said thrice.
I said, “You, also, O Prophet! will you not enter
into Paradise, excepting by God’s compassion?”
Then the Prophet put his hand on his head, and
said, “I shall not enter, except God cover me with
His mercy:” this he said thrice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man asked the Prophet what was the mark
whereby a man might know the reality of his
faith. He said, “If thou derive pleasure from the
good which thou hast done, and be grieved for the
evil which thou hast committed, thou art a true
believer.” The man said, “What doth a fault
really consist in?” He said, “When anything
pricketh thy conscience forsake it.”</p>

anything with respect to religion, receive it, and
when I order you about the affairs of the world

<p>The rhyming prose in which the Korān is written may
be seen to best advantage in this earliest phase of Mohammad’s
oratory, when the sentences are short and the
rhythm more <i>chantant</i> than in the later speeches. “The
Smiting” (p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>), will serve as a specimen of the sound of
the original Arabic, as far as it can be represented in
Roman characters:&mdash;</p>

Temple (the <i>Furthest Mosque</i>) at Jerusalem; upon which
Mohammadan theologians have raised a noble superstructure

worshipped the angels and jinn as daughters of God; and
it is against this polytheism and blasphemous relationship
that Mohammad protests, whilst he never denies but
contrariwise admits the existence of such spirits. Further
on (p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>) he refers to these angels and other Arabian
divinities, as beings who are not to be invoked, since they
can have no influence for good or ill, and who themselves
are in hope and fear of God’s mercy and torment,
like human beings. It should be noticed that hitherto
Mohammad has directed his preaching against disbelief in
the One God, but has not pointedly attacked the idolatry
of the Mekkans. In Y. S., however, he begins to speak
of <i>other gods</i> (p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>), and in the Third or Argumentative
Period, the angels and jinn which the Mekkans worshipped,
and represented in the shape of idols, are frequently
denounced, especially under the name of <i>Partners</i>

apparently caused some confusion among the faithful,
which this verse removed.</p>

<p>The “Children of Israel” speech is especially important,
since it contains more definite regulations of
conduct than any other of the orations delivered at
Mekka.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deception.</span> P. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>. <i>Obey God and obey the Apostle.</i>&mdash;This
is a sure indication of the Medina origin of at least
this verse, for the self-importance of the phrase would
have been inappropriate in Mohammad’s weak and insignificant
position at Mekka. (The speech is, however,
by some ascribed to the Mekka division.) Further on
the words <i>Believe in God and His Apostle</i> (in <span class="smcap">Iron</span>, p.
118), and <i>They who swear fealty to thee do but swear fealty
to God</i> (in <span class="smcap">Victory</span>, p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>), indicate the same spirit
of self-exaltation which began with the prophet’s prosperity
at Medina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Victory.</span> P. <a href="#Page_124">124</a>.&mdash;The victory in question was probably
the peaceful but real triumph of the Truce of
Hudeybia, in <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 6; though some commentators prefer
to regard the speech as prophetical of the conquest of
Mekka two years later.</p>

towards Mekka, which ended in the Truce of Hudeybia.
Mohammad punished them by refusing to allow them to
share in the booty which soon after fell to the faithful in
the Khaibar expedition; hence the reference on p. <a href="#Page_126">126</a>.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>. <i>In the valley of Mekka</i>: referring to the

<h3><a name="NOTES_LAW" id="NOTES_LAW"></a><span class="smcap">The Law Given at Medina.</span></h3>

<p>The forty paragraphs arranged on pp. <a href="#Page_133">133</a>-<a href="#Page_144">144</a>, contain,
it is believed, all the definite ordinances of Mohammad as
set forth in the Medina speeches, with the exception of
some regulations relating to women. The bulk of the
Medina speeches are indeed rather collections of separate
decisions or “rulings” put together for convenience of
reference by the Muslims themselves than separate and
complete orations. But as the practical teaching is interspersed
with frequent and verbose prophetical legends of
the kind with which the reader is already perhaps only too
familiar and with animadversions on the political parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
of Medina, and similar ephemeral matters, it has been
thought best to extract the marrow of these lengthy and
composite harangues, and place them in some sort of connected
order. Chapter II., for instance, “The Cow,”
contains 286 verses; the first half is filled with the usual
arguments and illustrations, and the old stories about
Adam and Moses; whilst the second half contains a
certain number of laws and precepts mixed with many
repetitions of the proofs and appeals to reason which
occur in most of the preceding speeches: altogether, 29
verses out of 286 are needed for the purpose of showing
what Mohammad actually prescribed in civil and religious
law. For an account of the modern interpretation of this
law, see <span class="smcap">Lane’s</span> <i>Modern Egyptians</i>, 5th ed. Ch. III.;
<span class="smcap">Sell’s</span> <i>Faith of Islam</i>; and <span class="smcap">Hughes’</span> <i>Notes on Mohammadanism</i>,
2d ed. 1877.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>. <i>Observe the prayer, and the middle prayer.</i> It
is not easy to make out the five daily prayers of Islam in
the Korān. In the speech entitled “Hūd” (Mekka,
Third Period, xi. 116) it is enjoined: “Observe prayer at
two ends of the day, and at two parts of the night”; and
again, in “T. H.” (xx. 130), the praises of God are to
be celebrated “before the rising of the sun and before its
setting, and at times of the night and at the ends of the
day”; and in “The Greeks” (xxx. 17) praise is ordained
“in the evening and in the morning, and at the evening
and at noon.” The Muslim commentators differ as to
the application of these injunctions to the five times of
prayer recognized throughout the Mohammadan world;
which are (1) just after sunset, (2) at nightfall, (3) at daybreak,
(4) just after noon, and (5) in the middle of the
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p><i>Turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque</i>: <i>i.e.</i> towards
the Kaaba of Mekka. Originally Mohammad placed the
Kibla, or direction of prayer, at Jerusalem; but after his
disagreement with the Jews of Medina he reverted to the
old Mekkan temple as the focus of Islām.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>. It is enacted (ii. 183) that the fast is to be
observed from the time when you can distinguish a white
thread from a black thread in the morning, till night;
but from nightfall till dawn the Muslim may eat and
drink and enjoy himself.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>. <i>Make mention of God’s name over the beasts</i>: <i>i.e.</i>
Sacrifice them, saying, “In the name of God.”</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>. The Korān contains a list of prohibited degrees
(“Women,” iv. 26, 27), which comprises mothers
and stepmothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, fostermothers,
fostersisters, mothers-in-law, stepdaughters,
daughters-in-law, and two sisters, and other men’s wives.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>. <i>Keep the women in houses.</i> Immuring was
afterwards changed to stoning both the man and the woman.</p>


<h3><a name="NOTES_TABLE_TALK" id="NOTES_TABLE_TALK"></a><span class="smcap">Table-Talk of Mohammad.</span></h3>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>. <i>Retaliation is equal.</i>&mdash;It is worth noticing,
that while sin is requited with equal punishment or with
forgiveness, good deeds are rewarded tenfold.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>. <i>Rising or setting of the sun.</i>&mdash;The exact
moment was forbidden, for fear of even the suspicion of
sun-worship.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_164">164</a>. It is recorded of the prophet, that when, being
on a journey, he alighted at any place, he did not say his
prayers until he had unsaddled his camel.</p>

<h2><a name="TN" id="TN"></a>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</h2>

<p>This book was written with many words which are archaic or obsolete by today's standards.
However, all such words (other than transliterations of Arabic) are listed in O.E.D., and
have been maintained in this book as they were in the original. The only changes to the text
were inserting omitted section and chapter titles in the <a href="#ANALYTICAL_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS">Analytical Table of Contents</a> and in the
<a href="#NOTES">Notes</a> chapter, and correcting such titles in those two locations when they did not match the
corresponding titles elsewhere in the text.</p>

<p class="mobile-only">The cover page was produced by the transcriber and is hereby placed in the public domain.
</p>

<p>The line <i>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful</i> is used
as an introduction or prolog to all the chapters of the Koran, with
two exceptions: This line does not appear at the beginning of chapter
ix. (which does not appear in this book). And in the case of the first
chapter, Fatihah (which does appear in this book), this line is part
of the poetry, not a prolog or introduction. I have left the line in
the book at the beginning of Fatihah separated from the rest of the
chapter because that is the way it appeared in the original text. This
representation is incorrect, there should be no break from the rest of
the chapter.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
